     A single dose of 300 mg mango leaf extract significantly improved performance accuracy across the tasks in the battery, with domain-specific effects seen in terms of enhanced performance on an ‘Accuracy of Attention’ factor and an ‘Episodic Memory’ factor. Performance was also improved across all three tasks (Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial 3s and Serial 7s subtraction tasks) that make up the Cognitive Demand Battery sub-section of the assessment. All of these cognitive benefits were seen across the post-dose assessments (30 min, 3 h, 5 h).

    These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.

    Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cancer death by 16%. A total of 75,454 participants were identified. Vitamin D supplementation statistically significantly reduced the risk of cancer death. In subgroup analyses, all cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation.

    Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.
