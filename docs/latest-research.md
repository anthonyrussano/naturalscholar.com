    Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities.  Three doses decreased body weight gain and reduced average food intake, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), FBG, leptin level, and MSBP. P-AMPK/AMPK and P-ACC protein levels were increased by carnosic acid. In conclusion, the activation of AMPK by CA can be proposed as a key mechanism against olanzapine-induced metabolic toxicity where the activation of AMPK increases fat consumption and regulates glucose hemostasis in the liver.
