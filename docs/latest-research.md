    Natural astaxanthin (NAX) supplementation reduces negative mood state parameters (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness. A total of 28 healthy subjects, half male and half female, with a median age of 42, supplemented with 12 mg per day of NAX or placebo. After an 8-week supplementation period, significant improvements were found in global mood state and related subscales: Vigor, Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion.

    Curcumin (a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root) significantly improved bone biomechanical properties (maximum load, breaking load, elastic load and the bone rigidity coefficient) and preserved bone microarchitecture. The present results also indicated that Curcumin regulated lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride and low‑density lipoprotein) and fasting blood glucose levels.

     Mango leaf extract significantly improved brain function and cognitive performance accuracy. Results showed enhanced ‘Accuracy of Attention’ and 'Episodic Memory’. Performance was also improved across Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial subtraction tasks, and other Cognitive Demand Battery tests. Cognitive benefits were assessed within 30 min, 3 h, and 5 h of dose. These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.

    ### Vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of cancer death by 16%

    Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cancer death by 16%. A total of 75,454 participants were identified. Vitamin D supplementation statistically significantly reduced the risk of cancer death. In subgroup analyses, all cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation.

    Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.
