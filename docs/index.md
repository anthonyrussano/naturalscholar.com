    ### **[Alpha Lipoic Acid](../research/natural-healing/lipoic-acid)** Attenuates Inflammatory Response in the Brain

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/lipoic acid.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">
    This study suggest that α-Lipoic Acid is a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammatory responses.  Alpha-Lipoic Acid has been suggested to have anti-dementia and anti-Alzheimer's Disease properties due to several actions, such as scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing inflammatory processes, and regenerating endogenous antioxidants.

    ### Uncooked **[Quinoa](../research/natural-healing/quinoa)** seeds and sprouts contain a toxic protein

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/Quinoa.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">
    This study found the presence of toxic proteins in quinoa seeds.  These toxic proteins demonstrated a loss of activity after 10-min incubation at 70°C. Considering that quinoa seeds are used as a food, we found that quinoin is cytotoxic against human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes. This toxin was found in seeds and in sprouted seeds. We suggest a thermal treatment of quinoa seeds before consumption in order to inactivate the toxin, particularly in sprouts, generally consumed raw.

    ### [Green Tea](../research/natural-healing/green-tea) Extract Improves Heart Muscle, May Help Treat Cardiomyopathies by Improving Mitochondrial Function

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/green tea.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">
    Previous studies have shown long-term in vivo administration of green tea catechin extract (GTE) resulted in an improvement of heart cell mechanical properties measured by a significant increase in hyperdynamic cardiomyocyte contractility (an increase in the rate of shortening and re-lengthening of heart muscle cells, more specifically the fraction of shortening due to the amplitude of calcium transient, and the rate of cytosolic calcium removal). In this study, cellular bioenergetics was found to be significantly improved by measuring the maximal mitochondrial respiration rate and the cellular ATP level. Notably, the improvement of mitochondrial function was associated with increased levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, whereas the cellular mitochondrial mass was unchanged. GTE supplementation improved cardiomyocyte mechanics and intracellular calcium dynamics, by lowering the expression of total phospholamban (PLB), which led to an increase of both the phosphorylated-PLB/PLB and the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase/PLB ratios. These findings suggest that GTE might be a valuable adjuvant tool for counteracting the occurrence and/or the progression of cardiomyopathies in which mitochondrial dysfunction and alteration of intracellular calcium dynamics constitute early pathogenic factors.

The clinical trials showed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp., and a reduction in plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein after the consumption of anthocyanins and ellagic acid. In conclusion, there is strong evidence in preclinical studies that dietary polyphenols can stimulate both the growth of microorganisms identified as prebiotic targets and an increase in the production of SCFA.

The present study found that treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, and tumor cell signaling. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and survival. Normal prostate epithelial cells remained unaffected by Rosemary Extract treatment. These findings suggest that Rosemary Extract has potent effects against prostate cancer and warrants further investigation.

    Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities. This study has shown that [grape juice](../research/natural-healing/grapes) can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota. The consumption of grape juice therefore, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.

    Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  This study states that Cordyceps supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher NK cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects,

    ### [Avocados](../research/natural-healing/avocado) improve cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running

    Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.

This mixture demonstrated a significant reduction in anthropometric parameters such as body weight (2.1%), w/h ratio (4%), and BMI (2.2%) along with the improvement in eating behaviour as well as appetite, indicated the potential body weight management effect. Appetite analysis revealed a significant improvement in uncontrolled eating and reduction in appetite.
