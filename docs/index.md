    ### Polyphenols have prebiotic effects; stimulate the growth of healthy gut microorganisms and increase production of Short Chain Fatty Acids

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/anthocyanins.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Consumption of polyphenols, especially catechins, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, increases the abundance of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Faecalibacterium spp. Moreover, polyphenols supplementation increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), including butyrate. The clinical trials showed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp., and a reduction in plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein after the consumption of anthocyanins and ellagic acid. In conclusion, there is strong evidence in preclinical studies that dietary polyphenols can stimulate both the growth of microorganisms identified as prebiotic targets and an increase in the production of SCFA.

    ### Beverages Rich in Resveratrol and Physical Activity Attenuate Metabolic Changes Induced by High-Fat Diet

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/grapes.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">

    Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities. This study has shown that grape juice can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota. The consumption of grape juice therefore, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.

    Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  This study states that Cordyceps supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher NK cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects,

    ### Avocados improve cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/avocado.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">

    Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.
