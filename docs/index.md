    ### Rosemary Extract has potent effects against prostate cancer

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/rosemary.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">It has been previously reported that rosemary extract (RE) has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. The present study found that treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, and tumor cell signaling. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with RE resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and survival while RE had no effect on normal prostate epithelial cells. These findings suggest that RE has potent effects against prostate cancer and warrants further investigation.

In this study, echinacea extract showed cytotoxic activity on breast cancer cells. No harmfull effects were observed on normal breast cells. Echinacea extract also showed a synergistic effect on cancer cells when used with paclitaxel (a chemotherapy medication).

    ### Honey, Mangosteen, Black Seed Oil, and Curcumin all binding inhibitors of Covid19

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/honey.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Three active compounds from honey, one from mangosteen, and one from black seed oil have scored a binding affinity (to the virus), which is better than lopinavir, the protease drug. Curcumin has shown the best pocket fitting binding affinity of 79%. However mangosteen turns out to be the best possible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19).

    ### Sulforaphane from broccoli reduces inflammation and liver cancer risk

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/broccoli.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Sulforaphane (SF), a broccoli-derived isothiocyanate, inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SF was shown to suppress liver inflammation within 24hrs of treatment. SF was not associated with any cellular toxicity, indicating the protective effect of SF against inflammatory responses. This study revealed the potential usage of broccoli-derived SF as a functional food ingredient in attenuating liver inflammation and reducing liver cancer risk development.

    ### Beverages Rich in Resveratrol and Physical Activity Attenuate Metabolic Changes Induced by High-Fat Diet

    Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities. This study has shown that grape juice can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota. The consumption of grape juice therefore, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.

    ### Cordyceps Supplementation has positive effects on immune response

    Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  This study states that Cordyceps supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher NK cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects,

    ### Avocados improve cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/avocado.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">

    Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.

    The present study used food-grade red chilies (Capsicum annum and Capsicum frutescens) and made a sustained-release formulation of capsaicinoids-rich red chili extract using fenugreek dietary fiber.  This mixture demonstrated a significant reduction in anthropometric parameters such as body weight (2.1%), w/h ratio (4%), and BMI (2.2%) along with the improvement in eating behaviour as well as appetite, indicated the potential body weight management effect. Appetite analysis revealed a significant improvement in uncontrolled eating and reduction in appetite.

    Natural astaxanthin (NAX) supplementation reduces negative mood state parameters (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness. A total of 28 healthy subjects, half male and half female, with a median age of 42, supplemented with 12 mg per day of NAX or placebo. After an 8-week supplementation period, significant improvements were found in global mood state and related subscales: Vigor, Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion.

    Curcumin (a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root) significantly improved bone biomechanical properties (maximum load, breaking load, elastic load and the bone rigidity coefficient) and preserved bone microarchitecture. The present results also indicated that Curcumin regulated lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride and low‑density lipoprotein) and fasting blood glucose levels.

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/mango.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">

     Mango leaf extract significantly improved brain function and cognitive performance accuracy. Results showed enhanced ‘Accuracy of Attention’ and 'Episodic Memory’. Performance was also improved across Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial subtraction tasks, and other Cognitive Demand Battery tests. Cognitive benefits were assessed within 30 min, 3 h, and 5 h of dose. These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.
