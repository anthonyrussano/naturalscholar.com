    ### Beverages Rich in Resveratrol and Physical Activity Attenuate Metabolic Changes Induced by High-Fat Diet

    Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities. This study has shown that grape juice can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota. The consumption of grape juice therefore, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.

    ### Resveratrol for Alzheimer's may prevent neuronal death, stop amyloid deposition, and promote blood brain barrier inegrity

    Resveratrol treatment has been shown to preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Resveratrol also induced adaptive immune responses that promoted brain resilience to amyloid deposition.  Resveratrol may slow cognitive decline in AD, and may arrest neuronal death.  Resveratrol may seal off a leaky blood brain barrier and contribute to cognitive and functional improvement.

    ### Cordyceps Supplementation has positive effects on immune response

    Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  This study states that Cordyceps supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher NK cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects,

    ### Avocados improve cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running

    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/avocado.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">

    Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.

    Rosemary and ginger essential oils were tested for antimicrobial activities and both demonstrated complete (100%) inhibition against K. pneumonia bacteria (a pathogen in outbreaks of hospital infections).

    ### Red Chili Extract has significant improvement on Overweight Subjects

    The present study used food-grade red chilies (Capsicum annum and Capsicum frutescens) and made a sustained-release formulation of capsaicinoids-rich red chili extract using fenugreek dietary fiber.  This mixture demonstrated a significant reduction in anthropometric parameters such as body weight (2.1%), w/h ratio (4%), and BMI (2.2%) along with the improvement in eating behaviour as well as appetite, indicated the potential body weight management effect. Appetite analysis revealed a significant improvement in uncontrolled eating and reduction in appetite.

    Natural astaxanthin (NAX) supplementation reduces negative mood state parameters (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness. A total of 28 healthy subjects, half male and half female, with a median age of 42, supplemented with 12 mg per day of NAX or placebo. After an 8-week supplementation period, significant improvements were found in global mood state and related subscales: Vigor, Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion.

    Curcumin (a natural polyphenolic compound extracted from the turmeric root) significantly improved bone biomechanical properties (maximum load, breaking load, elastic load and the bone rigidity coefficient) and preserved bone microarchitecture. The present results also indicated that Curcumin regulated lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride and low‑density lipoprotein) and fasting blood glucose levels.

    ### Mango leaf extract Improves Cognitive Function in Healthy Adults

     Mango leaf extract significantly improved brain function and cognitive performance accuracy. Results showed enhanced ‘Accuracy of Attention’ and 'Episodic Memory’. Performance was also improved across Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial subtraction tasks, and other Cognitive Demand Battery tests. Cognitive benefits were assessed within 30 min, 3 h, and 5 h of dose. These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.

    Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cancer death by 16%. A total of 75,454 participants were identified. Vitamin D supplementation statistically significantly reduced the risk of cancer death. In subgroup analyses, all cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation.

    Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.
