    ### **[Alpha Lipoic Acid](./research/lipoic-acid)** Attenuates Inflammatory Response in the Brain

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/lipoic acid.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">
    This study suggest that α-Lipoic Acid is a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammatory responses.  Alpha-Lipoic Acid has been suggested to have anti-dementia and anti-Alzheimer's Disease properties due to several actions, such as scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing inflammatory processes, and regenerating endogenous antioxidants.

    ### Uncooked **[Quinoa](./research/quinoa)** seeds and sprouts contain a toxic protein

    <img loading="lazy" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/Quinoa.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">
    This study found the presence of toxic proteins in quinoa seeds.  These toxic proteins demonstrated a loss of activity after 10-min incubation at 70°C. Considering that quinoa seeds are used as a food, we found that quinoin is cytotoxic against human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes. This toxin was found in seeds and in sprouted seeds. We suggest a thermal treatment of quinoa seeds before consumption in order to inactivate the toxin, particularly in sprouts, generally consumed raw.

The clinical trials showed an increased abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp., and a reduction in plasma lipopolysaccharide-binding protein after the consumption of anthocyanins and ellagic acid. In conclusion, there is strong evidence in preclinical studies that dietary polyphenols can stimulate both the growth of microorganisms identified as prebiotic targets and an increase in the production of SCFA.

The present study found that treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation, survival, migration, and tumor cell signaling. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with Rosemary Extract resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation and survival. Normal prostate epithelial cells remained unaffected by Rosemary Extract treatment. These findings suggest that Rosemary Extract has potent effects against prostate cancer and warrants further investigation.

In this study, echinacea extract showed cytotoxic activity on breast cancer cells. No harmfull effects were observed on normal breast cells. Echinacea extract also showed a synergistic effect on cancer cells when used with paclitaxel (a chemotherapy medication).

Curcumin has shown the best pocket fitting binding affinity of 79%. However mangosteen turns out to be the best possible inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19).

SF was shown to suppress liver inflammation within 24hrs of treatment. SF was not associated with any cellular toxicity, indicating the protective effect of SF against inflammatory responses. This study revealed the potential usage of broccoli-derived SF as a functional food ingredient in attenuating liver inflammation and reducing liver cancer risk development.

    Saturated fats in the diet can cause deleterious effects on health, which could be minimized through physical activity and the consumtion of functional foods with  medicinal qualities. This study has shown that [grape juice](./research/grapes) can help lower lipid peroxidation (fat oxidation), interleukin-6 (IL6) concentration and systolic blood pressure (SBP) while also positivley increasing healthy gut microbiota. The consumption of grape juice therefore, together with physical exercise, may be able to promote beneficial metabolic changes even in the presence of a traditional High Fat Diet.

    Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells, are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  This study states that Cordyceps supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher NK cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects,

    ### [Avocados](./research/avocado) improve cardiovascular and autonomic recovery following submaximal running

    Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.

    The present study used food-grade red chilies (Capsicum annum and Capsicum frutescens) and made a sustained-release formulation of capsaicinoids-rich red chili extract using fenugreek dietary fiber.  This mixture demonstrated a significant reduction in anthropometric parameters such as body weight (2.1%), w/h ratio (4%), and BMI (2.2%) along with the improvement in eating behaviour as well as appetite, indicated the potential body weight management effect. Appetite analysis revealed a significant improvement in uncontrolled eating and reduction in appetite.

    Natural astaxanthin (NAX) supplementation reduces negative mood state parameters (depression and fatigue) and improves global mood state and thus supports mental wellness. A total of 28 healthy subjects, half male and half female, with a median age of 42, supplemented with 12 mg per day of NAX or placebo. After an 8-week supplementation period, significant improvements were found in global mood state and related subscales: Vigor, Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, and Confusion.

     Mango leaf extract significantly improved brain function and cognitive performance accuracy. Results showed enhanced ‘Accuracy of Attention’ and 'Episodic Memory’. Performance was also improved across Rapid Visual Information Processing, Serial subtraction tasks, and other Cognitive Demand Battery tests. Cognitive benefits were assessed within 30 min, 3 h, and 5 h of dose. These results provide the first demonstration of cognition enhancement following consumption of mango leaf extract and add to previous research showing that polyphenols and polyphenol rich extracts can improve brain function.

    Resveratrol treatment has been shown to preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Resveratrol also induced adaptive immune responses that promoted brain resilience to amyloid deposition.  Resveratrol may slow cognitive decline in AD, and may arrest neuronal death.  Resveratrol may seal off a leaky blood brain barrier and contribute to cognitive and functional improvement.

    Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.
