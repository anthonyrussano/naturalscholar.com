# Cordyceps

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/cordyceps.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">**Cordyceps** is a genus of ascomycete fungi (sac fungi) that includes about 400 species. Most Cordyceps species are endoparasitoids, parasitic mainly on insects and other arthropods (they are thus entomopathogenic fungi); a few are parasitic on other fungi. The generic name Cordyceps is derived from the Greek word κορδύλη kordýlē, meaning "club", and the Greek word κεφαλή cephali, meaning "head".

## Healing Properties

### Immune System Modulator

Cordyceps Supplementation has shown positive effects on immune response. Supplementation over 12 weeks showed significantly higher Natural killer<sup>*</sup> (NK) cell activity and Immunoglobulin A levels (an antibody blood protein) compared to the placebo group. These results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects.[^1]

> <sup>*</sup> Natural killer cells are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. The role of NK cells is analogous to that of T cells in the adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.

**Abstract:**  Purpose: Upper respiratory tract infections are major causes of the common cold throughout the world. Cordyceps militaris (C. militaris) is a well-known functional food for its anti-fatigue and immunomodulating activities. On the other hand, there are no reports on the protective effect against upper respiratory tract infections (URI). This study was a 12 week randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers.
Methods: A total of 100 subjects 20 ~ 70 years of age with a history of at least two colds in the year were enrolled in the study. The participants were required to record any adverse events and rate any cold-related incidents in a diary during the investigation period. The efficacy end point was the symptoms and incidence of URI, and changes in cytokines, IgA and natural killer (NK) cell activity. Results: The Cordyceps militaris group over 12 weeks showed no significant impact on the incidence and symptomatology of URI compared to the placebo group. On the other hand, the experimental group showed significantly higher NK cell activity (p = 0.047) and IgA level (p = 0.035) compared to the placebo group. The NK-cell activity and IgA level were increased significantly by Cordyceps militaris over 12 weeks. Conclusion: The results suggest the possible beneficial immunomodulating effects, but the protective effects on URI could not be demonstrated under these conditions. Additional research will be needed to determine the efficacy and mechanisms of Cordyceps militaris function.
