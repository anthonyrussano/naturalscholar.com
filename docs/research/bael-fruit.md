Also known as Bengal quince, golden apple, Japanese bitter orange, stone apple or wood apple.

## Composition

- The bael tree contains furocoumarins (Note: Furanocoumarins, or furocoumarins, are a class of organic chemical compounds produced by a variety of plants. Many furanocoumarin compounds are toxic.)
    - Including xanthotoxol and the methyl ester of alloimperatorin
- The bael tree fruit contains coumarins such as marmelosin (also known as imperatorin)
-Flavonoids
    - Rutin and marmesin
- Essential oils
- Alkaloids
    - allocryptopine
    - O-isopentenylhalfordinol
    - O-methylhafordinol.
    - Aegeline (N-[2-hydroxy-2(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide) is a constituent that can be extracted from bael leaves.

Aeglemarmelosine, molecular formula C16H15NO2 [α]27D+7.89° (c 0.20, CHCl3), has been isolated as an orange viscous oil.

## Preparation

It takes about 11 months to ripen on the tree and can reach the size of a large grapefruit or pomelo, and some are even larger. The shell is so hard it must be cracked with a hammer or machete. The fibrous yellow pulp is very aromatic. It has been described as tasting of marmalade and smelling of roses.

The fruits can be eaten either fresh from trees or after being dried and produced into pulp powder or nectar. If fresh, the juice is strained and sweetened to make a drink similar to lemonade.

The leaves and small shoots are eaten as salad greens.

The leaves, bark, roots, fruits, and seeds are used in traditional medicine.
