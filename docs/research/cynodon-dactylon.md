Also known as Vilfa stellata, Bermuda grass, Dhoob, dūrvā grass, dubo, dog's tooth grass, Bahama grass, devil's grass, couch grass, Indian doab, arugampul, grama, wiregrass and scutch grass.

## Composition

Cynodon dactylon contains various types of phytochemicals such as alkaloids, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, tannins, sterols, glycosides, proteins, amino acids, and carbohydrate.[^2]

Phytochemical analysis showed that Cynodon dactylon contain flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, terpenoids, triterpenoids, steroids, saponins, tannins, resins, phytosterols, reducing sugars, carbohydrates, proteins, and volatiles and non-volatile oils, and also contain nutrients such as fat, fiber, iron, calcium, phosphorus, potassium and beta-carotene.[^2]

## Healing Properties

### Anti-allergic

### Anticancer

Every year, several secondary metabolites are extracted from the plants and used as new sources for the treatment of various cancers.[^2]

### Antimicrobial

[^1]: **Title:** In vitro antilithiatic potential of Kalanchoe pinnata, Emblica officinalis, Bambusa nutans, and Cynodon dactylon<br>**Author(s):** Atul K Sohgaura, Papiya Bigoniya, B Shrivastava<br>**Institution(s):** School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Jaipur National University, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, Dr. Satyendra Kumar Memorial (DKSM) College of Pharmacy, Ram Krishna Dharmarth Foundation (RKDF) University, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India<br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Pharmacy & BioAllied Sciences</i><br>**Date:** 4-Jun-2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>**Objective:** The study aims at the exploration of calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal growth inhibition potential of Cynodon dactylon, Emblica officinalis, Kalanchoe pinnata, and Bambusa nutans ethyl acetate fraction rich in polyphenol and flavonoid. **Materials and Methods:** Ethyl acetate fraction was separated from the hydromethanolic extract of C. dactylon, E. officinalis, K. pinnata, and B. nutans followed by quantitative analysis for total polyphenol and flavonoid content. Ethyl acetate fraction of all the plants were subjected to in vitro screening for the inhibition of CaOx crystals growth induced by sodium oxalate. **Results:** The results signify rich presence of polyphenols and flavonoids in K. pinnata and E. officinalis ethyl acetate fractions followed by C. dactylon and B. nutans. Ethyl acetate fractions of B. nutans shoot, E. officinalis fruit, and K. pinnata leaf have excellent in vitro CaOx crystal growth inhibition potential based on both the comparative concentration and the time level to achieve IC50. **Conclusion:** The study outcome substantiates potential in vitro CaOx crystal dissolution and crystal growth inhibition properties of E. officinalis, B. nutans, C. dactylon, and K. pinnata. Rich presence of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and luteolin in ethyl acetate fraction of B. nutans leaf, and chebulinic acid, chebulagic acid, gallic acid, ellagic acid, and quercetin of E. officinalis may have produced prominent crystal aggregation inhibition response.</i><br>**Link:** [http://www.jpbsonline.org/article.asp?issn=0975-7406;year=2018;volume=10;issue=2;spage=83;epage=89;aulast=Sohgaura](http://www.jpbsonline.org/article.asp?issn=0975-7406;year=2018;volume=10;issue=2;spage=83;epage=89;aulast=Sohgaura)<br>**Citations:**
