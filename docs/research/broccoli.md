<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/broccoli.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">**Broccoli**

## Composition

- Broccoli sprout juice contains **sulforaphanyl-amine**.[^2]
- Broccoli sprouts are naturally enriched in glucoraphanin,the biological precursor to the anticancer compound [sulforaphane](/sulforaphane).[^2]
- Vitamin C
- Flavonoids
- Glucosinolates

## Healing Properties

### Anticancer (anticancer)

### Antiinflammatory

Broccoli is effective in preventing inflammatory responses.[^4]

### Prostate Health

### Weight Loss

### Hepatic Protection

(prevent damage to the liver) Dietary broccoli exerts a substantial protective effect on the liver.[^3]

- Broccoli consumption helps reduce plasma alanine aminotransferase concentrations in the liver. This is an enzyme found in the liver, normally at low levels. Increased levels of this enzyme are associated with liver damage and its level is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.[^3]

- Sulforaphane (an active compound in broccoli) protects against liver damage, indicating its potential to treat liver diseases.[^4]

Sulforaphane from broccoli reduces inflammation and liver cancer risk[^5]

Sulforaphane (SF), a broccoli-derived isothiocyanate, inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. SF was shown to suppress liver inflammation within 24hrs of treatment. SF was not associated with any cellular toxicity, indicating the protective effect of SF against inflammatory responses. This study revealed the potential usage of broccoli-derived SF as a functional food ingredient in attenuating liver inflammation and reducing liver cancer risk development.[^5]

# Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer Treatment / Prevention

Medicinal vegetables such as broccoli and their derivative phyto-compounds are being increasingly recognized as useful complementary treatments for cancer.  Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables (i.e. broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower), is considered a potential anticancer agent that prevents the development of certain types of tumors by activating tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in apoptosis and detoxification. I3C suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis.[^1]

- Broccoli is effective in preventing carcinogenesis.[^4]

#### Bladder Cancer

#### Colorectal cancer

#### Prostate Cancer

#### Ovarian cancer

#### Cervix carcinoma

#### Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

(a form of liver cancer) Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered development of hepatic tumorigenesis.[^3]

### Diabetes

Broccoli is effective in preventing diabetes.[^4]

### Obesity

### Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)

(hepatic lipidosis) Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered NAFLD development enhanced by a Western diet.[^3]

- Dietary consumption of freeze-dried broccoli was shown to lower the level of hepatic triglycerides.[^3]
- Dietary broccoli decreased relative liver mass.[^3]

In recent years, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has increased, especially among oncology patients. Treatment options are limited in androgen-independent prostate cancer. To reduce this tremendous health burden, new approaches have been directed toward extremes of the disease spectrum centering on strategies for prostate cancer prevention and for treating advanced androgen-independent cancers. Medicinal herbs and their derivative phytocompounds are being increasingly recognized as useful complementary treatments for cancer. Great number of clinical studies have reported the beneficial effects of herbal medicines on the survival, immune modulation, and quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients, when these herbal medicines are used in combination with conventional therapeutics. Although, tremendous efforts have been done in phytomedicine and phytotherapy, we still have a long way to go.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://www.scitechnol.com/peer-review/phytotherapy-of-prostate-cancerhow-far-are-we-MPWY.pdf)<br>**Citations:**

Due to its health promoting value, also broccoli sprout juice is becoming very popular.
The present study aimed to quantitatively assess the conversion of GR to its hydrolysis products, SFN and SFN-nitrile, during the juice preparation process. We demonstrated that SFN plus SFN-nitrile yield from glucoraphanin is quite low (≈25%) and that some SFN is lost during the juice preparation partially due to the spontaneous conversion to sulforaphane-amine or conjugation to GSH and proteins naturally present in the juice. Our results demonstrate that the detection of the sole SFN free form does not provide reliable information about the real concentration of this functional compound in the juice.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.06.089)<br>**Citations:**

Without treatment, NAFLD may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a cancer with a high mortality rate. The consumption of broccoli in the United States has greatly increased in the last 2 decades. Epidemiologic studies show that incorporating brassica vegetables into the daily diet lowers the risk of several cancers, although, to our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate HCC prevention through dietary broccoli. Objective: We aimed to determine the impact of dietary broccoli on hepatic lipid metabolism and the progression of NAFLD to HCC. Our hypothesis was that broccoli decreases both hepatic lipidosis and the development of HCC in a mouse model of Western diet–enhanced liver cancer. Methods: Adult 5-wk-old male B6C3F1 mice received a control diet (AIN-93M) or a Western diet (high in lard and sucrose, 19% and 31%, wt:wt, respectively), with or without freeze-dried broccoli (10%, wt:wt). Starting the following week, mice were treated once per week with diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 45 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12 wk). Hepatic gene expression, lipidosis, and tumor outcomes were analyzed 6 mo later, when mice were 9 mo old. Results: Mice receiving broccoli exhibited lower hepatic triglycerides (P < 0.001) and NAFLD scores (P < 0.0001), decreased plasma alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.0001), suppressed activation of hepatic CD68+ macrophages (P < 0.0001), and slowed initiation and progression of hepatic neoplasm. Hepatic Cd36 was downregulated by broccoli feeding (P = 0.006), whereas microsomal triglyceride transfer protein was upregulated (P = 0.045), supporting the finding that dietary broccoli decreased hepatic triglycerides. Conclusion: Long-term consumption of whole broccoli countered both NAFLD development enhanced by a Western diet and hepatic tumorigenesis induced by DEN in male B6C3F1 mice.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://dx.doi.org/10.3945%2Fjn.115.228148)<br>**Citations:**

Mice were treated intravenously with SFN at 12 h after LPS treatment.

**Abstract:** Cancer is a worldwide health problem, notably liver cancer. Under inflammatory conditions, pro-inflammatory cytokine can stimulate the production of hepcidin, the principal hormone for controlling iron status, leading to iron deficiency and subsequent anaemia. Sulforaphane (SF), a broccoli-derived isothiocyanate (ITC), have been indicated to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL-6). Therefore, the impact of SF on IL-6 and hepcidin production in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in human cancer HepG2 cells was investigated. SF suppressed LPS-induced transcription and secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) after 24hrs of treatment at physiologically relevant concentration (2 μM). This was associated with a decrease in hepcidin secretion. SF was not associated with any cellular toxicity, indicating the protective effect of SF against inflammatory responses including inflammatory hepcidin. This study revealed the potential usage of broccoli-derived SF as a functional food ingredient in attenuating the inflammation-induced hepatic hepcidin and reducing liver cancer risk development.
