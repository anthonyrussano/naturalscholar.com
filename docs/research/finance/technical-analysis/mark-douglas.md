# Mark Douglas 

Mark Douglas may be considered the father of trading psychology.  He is most well known for authoring the book, "Trading in the Zone."

> "If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of trading, this is it: At the very core of one's ability 1) to trade without fear or overconfidence, 2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, 3) stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and 4) spontaneously enter the 'zone,' it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncertain outcome with an edge in your favor." -- Trading in the Zone
