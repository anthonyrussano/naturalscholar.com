# Mark Douglas 

Mark Douglas may be considered the father of trading psychology.  He is most well known for authoring the book, "Trading in the Zone."

> "If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of trading, this is it: <br>At the very core of one's ability <br> 1) to trade without fear or overconfidence, <br>2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, <br>3) stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and <br>4) spontaneously enter the 'zone,' it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncertain outcome with an edge in your favor." -- Trading in the Zone

"Every trader - is the market." -- Mark Douglas

### The Disciplined Trader [^1]

- Success in trading is 80 percent psychological and 20 percent one's methodology, be it fundamental or technical.
    - For example, you can have a mediocre knowledge of fundamental and technical information, and if you are in psychological control, you can make money.
    - Conversely, you may have a great system, one that you have tested and has performed well for a long period of time, yet if the psychological control is not there, you will be the loser.

> A good trader knows from experience that over a period of time he may engage in more losing trades than winning ones. But money management, and a careful assay of the risks protected by realistic stops will keep the trader out of trouble and ensure that on the "big" moves, he will profit.

- Money management is comprised of two essential elements: psychological management and risk management.
    - Risk management stems from the psychological factors being truly understood by the trader and "in place" before risk is even considered.

- Reading and passively analyzing your motivations are a necessity
    - The acid test comes with trading under pressure
    - Question every trade
        - What motivated it?
        - How was the trade managed?
        - Was it successful? Why?
        - Did you lose? Why?
    - Write down your assessment and refer to your comments before making your next trade.
