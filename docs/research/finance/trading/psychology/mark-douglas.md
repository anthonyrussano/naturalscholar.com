# Mark Douglas 

Mark Douglas is the father of trading psychology.  He is most well known for authoring the book, "Trading in the Zone."

> "If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of trading, this is it: <br>At the very core of one's ability <br> 1) to trade without fear or overconfidence, <br>2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, <br>3) stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and <br>4) spontaneously enter the 'zone,' it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncertain outcome with an edge in your favor." -- Trading in the Zone

"Every trader - is the market." -- Mark Douglas
