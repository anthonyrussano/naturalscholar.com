# The Disciplined Trader

## Background

The Disciplined Trader is a book which introduced the concept of trading psychology.  Author Mark Douglas offers a step-by-step process to understand and implement money management in terms of his trading psychology.

## Notes

In the following sections I have set out to document the key ideas from each chapter of The Disciplined Trader as I read through it.

### Preface / Introduction

- Success in trading is 80 percent psychological and 20 percent one's methodology, be it fundamental or technical.
    - For example, you can have a mediocre knowledge of fundamental and technical information, and if you are in psychological control, you can make money.
    - Conversely, you may have a great system, one that you have tested and has performed well for a long period of time, yet if the psychological control is not there, you will be the loser.

> A good trader knows from experience that over a period of time he may engage in more losing trades than winning ones. But money management, and a careful assay of the risks protected by realistic stops will keep the trader out of trouble and ensure that on the "big" moves, he will profit.

- Money management is comprised of two essential elements: psychological management and risk management.
    - Risk management stems from the psychological factors being truly understood by the trader and "in place" before risk is even considered.

- Reading and passively analyzing your motivations are a necessity
    - The acid test comes with trading under pressure
    - Question every trade
        - What motivated it?
        - How was the trade managed?
        - Was it successful? Why?
        - Did you lose? Why?
    - Write down your assessment and refer to your comments before making your next trade.

*The grim reaper who kills off all "your equity" and disappears with your profits is not the mysterious and ubiquitous "they" but a simple misguided "you."*

> Medea said just before she murdered her children, "I know what evil I'm about to do, but my irrational self is stronger than my resolution."  If this sentiment reflects your mind set when you trade, then *The Disciplined Trader* is definitely the type of book you should be reading.
