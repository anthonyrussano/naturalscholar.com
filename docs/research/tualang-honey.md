[^1]: **Title:** Review of the Medicinal Effects of Tualang Honey and a Comparison with Manuka Honey<br>**Author(s):** Sarfarz Ahmed and Nor Hayati Othman<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia<br>**Publication:** <i>The Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences</i><br>**Date:** 2013 May<br>**Abstract:** <i>ualang honey (TH) is a Malaysian multifloral jungle honey. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of studies published in medical databases regarding its potential health benefits. The honey is produced by the rock bee (Apis dorsata), which builds hives on branches of tall Tualang trees located mainly in the north-western region of Peninsular Malaysia. This review collates the results of the various studies of TH that range from research on tissue culture to randomised control clinical trials. Findings thus far show that, TH has antimicrobial, Antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antimutagenic, antitumor, and antidiabetic properties, in addition to wound-healing attributes. Some of its properties are similar to the well-researched Manuka honey (New Zealand and/or Australian monofloral honey). Distinct differences include higher phenolics, flavonoids, and 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF). Compared with Manuka honey, TH is also more effective against some gram-negative bacterial strains in burn wounds.</i><br>**Link:** [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743976/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3743976/)<br>**Citations:**
