We investigated whether resveratrol can prevent hypertension induced by maternal plus post-weaning HF diets in adult offspring via the above-mentioned mechanisms.Female Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal (ND) or 60% high-fructose (HF) diet during gestation and lactation. Male offspring were assigned to five groups (maternal diet/post-weaning diet; n = 8/group): ND/ND, ND/HF, HF/ND, HF/HF, and HF/HF+ Resveratrol. Resveratrol (50 mg/L) was administered in drinking water from weaning to three months of age. We found that HF/HF induced hypertension in adult offspring. Maternal HF diet altered gut microbiota composition in adult offspring, including decreasing the abundance of genera Bacteroides, Dysgonomonas, and Turicibacter, while increasing phylum Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia muciniphila. Additionally, HF/HF diets increased oxidative stress and decreased renal mRNA expression of Prkaa2, Prkag2, Ppara, Pparb, Ppargc1a, and Sirt4. Resveratrol reduced renal oxidative stress, activated nutrient-sensing signals, modulated gut microbiota, and prevented associated HF/HF-induced programmed hypertension. Targeting oxidative stress, nutrient-sensing signals, and gut microbiota by resveratrol might be a useful therapeutic strategy for treatment of hypertension induced by excessive consumption of fructose in the adult rat offspring.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201800066](https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201800066)<br>**Citations:**

Although its etiology remains unknown, genetic and environmental risk factors have been associated with this disorder, including the exposure to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy. Resveratrol (RSV) is an Antiinflammatory and antioxidant molecule known to prevent social impairments in the VPA animal model of autism. This study aimed to analyze the effects of prenatal exposure to VPA, as well as possible preventive effects of RSV, on sensory behavior, the localization of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV+) neurons in sensory brain regions and the expression of proteins of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Pregnant rats were treated daily with RSV (3.6 mg/kg) from E6.5 to E18.5 and injected with VPA (600 mg/kg) in the E12.5. Male pups were analyzed in Nest Seeking (NS) behavior and in whisker nuisance task (WNT). At P30, the tissues were removed and analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Our data showed for the first time an altered localization of PV+-neurons in primary sensory cortex and amygdala. We also showed a reduced level of gephyrin in the primary somatosensory area (PSSA) of VPA animals. The treatment with RSV prevented all the aforementioned alterations triggered by VPA. Our data shed light on the relevance of sensory component in ASD and highlights the interplay between RSV and VPA animal model as an important tool to investigate the pathophysiology of ASD.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsyn.2018.00009](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsyn.2018.00009)<br>**Citations:**   

[^3]: **Title:** Resveratrol induced apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma SGC‐7901 cells via activation of mitochondrial pathway<br>**Author(s):** Yining Yang, Xinen Huang, Senqing Chen, Guojian Ma, Ming Zhu, Feng Yan, Jun Yu<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Molecular Biology, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer ResearchNanjing, China<br>**Publication:** <i>Asia-Pacific Journal of Clinical Oncology</i><br>**Date:** January 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>**Background** Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic compound and its anticancer effect has been receiving considerable attention. Previous studies showed that resveratrol could inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma cells and apoptosis induction was an important mechanism. However, whether mitochondrial pathway was involved in resveratrol‐induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer was not very clear. **Methods** The cells were examined by 3‐(4,5‐dimethyl‐2‐thiazolyl)‐2,5‐diphenyl‐2‐H‐tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Annexin V/PI staining assay, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cell morphological assessment, cytochrome c release assay, and Western blotting assay. **Results** In this study, we found that resveratrol induced apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma SGC‐7901 cells. Cleaved PARP was observed and caspase‐3 was activated by resveratrol. Next, the mitochondrial membrane potential of cells dissipated after the cells were treated by resveratrol. Moreover, we found that pro‐caspase 9 was downregulated and cytochrome c released from mitochondrial to the cytosol. We also found that the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl‐2 was increased in the treated cells. We finally showed that resveratrol inhibited the proliferation of SGC‐7901 xerograph in vivo. **Conclusions** Collectively, our findings demonstrate that resveratrol triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway in SGC‐7901 cells, which provide more basis for resveratrol acting as antitumor agents in cancer therapy.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12841](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12841)<br>**Citations:**

Little is known about the role of PLSCR1 in the occurrence and development of cervical cancer. Here, we demonstrated that resveratrol significantly inhibited both the growth of HeLa cells and expression of PLSCR1, which can be recovered by gain of function of PLSCR1. These results suggest that resveratrol mediated cell growth inhibition can be regulated by PLSCR1.</i><br>**Link:** [http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/resveratrol-significantly-inhibits-the-occurrence-and-development-of-cervical-cancer-by-regulating-plscr1-9827.html](http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/resveratrol-significantly-inhibits-the-occurrence-and-development-of-cervical-cancer-by-regulating-plscr1-9827.html)<br>**Citations:**

We aimed to analyze the effects of resveratrol on the brain status of control non-transgenic (NoTg) and AD transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice to discern the mechanisms involved in a potential inducement of resilience against age-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mice were fed with a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of resveratrol from 2 months of age during 10 months. Resveratrol administration induced complete protection against memory loss and brain pathology in 3xTg-AD mice, and also induced cognitive enhancement in healthy NoTg mice. Resveratrol improved exploration and reduced anxiety in both mouse strains, indicative of well-being. Resveratrol reduced the presence of Aβ and p-tau pathology in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mouse. Proteostasis analysis showed the following in both NoTg and 3xTg-AD mice: (i) increased levels of the amyloid-degrading enzyme neprilysin, (ii) reduction of the amyloidogenic secretase BACE1, and (iii) increase of proteasome protein levels and enhancement of proteasome activity. Resveratrol also increased AMPK protein levels, then upregulating the SIRT1 pathway, as shown by the activation of PGC-1α and CREB in both mice, resulting in further beneficial changes. Our data demonstrated that resveratrol induces cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection against amyloid and tau pathologies. Improvement of proteostasis by resveratrol, in both healthy and AD mice, suggests that it is a mechanism of brain resilience and defense against neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of aberrant proteins.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-018-1157-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-018-1157-y)<br>**Citations:**

The study used young (3 months) and old (12 months) male and female Wistar albino rats. Resveratrol was given in the drinking water (0.05 mg/ml; approximately 7.5 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. In the exercise group, all rats performed treadmill running at 20 m/min on a 0° incline, 40 min/day, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. Acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent and sodium nitroprusside-mediated, endothelium-independent relaxations of rat thoracic aorta and blood levels of biomarkers were separately changed by resveratrol intake and exercise-training in an age and gender-dependent manner. Antioxidant enzymes and eNOS expressions in vessels were elevated by resveratrol and exercise. Resveratrol and exercise enhanced gene expressions of non-selective PDE1, 2, 3 and cAMP selective PDE4 but not cGMP selective PDE5 in the aorta. In addition, the aortic mRNA expression of inflammation markers were altered by resveratrol and exercise-training. The results of the study demonstrated that vessel responsiveness and biomarkers related to vascular functions were altered by resveratrol consumption and exercise-training in an age and gender-dependent manner.<i> </i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.06.009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.06.009)<br>**Citations:**

We aimed to investigate the effect of Resveratrol (RSV) (10 mg/kg) on oxidative and nitrosative stress in the intestinal wall and morphoquantitative aspects of the myenteric plexus of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum in diabetic rats. Twenty-four rats were distributed into four groups (n = 6/group): control (C group), control treated with RSV (CR group), diabetic (D group), and diabetic treated with RSV (DR group) for 120 days. Immunohistochemical staining techniques for the general neuronal population, nitrergic and calretinin neuronal subpopulations, enteric glial cells and glial fibrillary acid protein were performed in the myenteric plexus. Furthermore, parameters of oxidative and nitrosative stress were analyzed in the intestinal wall. RSV attenuated oxidative and nitrosative stress and prevented neuronal loss and hypertrophy of the HuC/D-IR, nNOS-IR and CALR-IR neuronal subpopulations in the DR group compared with the D group (P < 0.05). In addition, RSV prevented the increase in glial fibrillary acid protein fluorescence in the DR group compared with the D (P < 0.05). These results suggest that RSV has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects in myenteric plexus in rats with experimental DM.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.030](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.06.030)<br>**Citations:**
