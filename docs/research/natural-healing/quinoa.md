## Preparation

!!! warning
    Uncooked quinoa seeds and sprouts contain a toxic protein, quinoin.[^1]  Quinoin is cytotoxic against human fibroblasts and human keratinocytes.[^1] However, these toxic proteins lose activity after 10-min incubation at 70°C.[^1]

Thermal treatment of quinoa seeds and sprouts (minimum 10-min incubation at 70°C) is recommended before consumption in order to inactivate toxins.[^1]

**Abstract:** This study investigates on the presence of toxic proteins in quinoa seeds. To this aim, a plethora of biochemical approaches were adopted for the purification and characterization of quinoin, a type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) contained in quinoa seeds. We determined its melting temperature (68.2±0.6°C) and thermostability (loss of activity after 10-min incubation at 70°C). Considering that quinoa seeds are used as a food, we found that quinoin is cytotoxic against BJ-5ta (human fibroblasts) and HaCaT (human keratinocytes) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, in an in vitro digestive pepsin-trypsin treatment, 30% of quinoin is resistant to enzymatic cleavage. This toxin was found in seeds (0.23 mg/g of seeds) and in sprouted seeds obtained after 24-h (0.12 mg/g of sprout) and 48-h (0.09 mg/g of sprout). We suggest a thermal treatment of quinoa seeds before consumption in order to inactivate the toxin, particularly in sprouts, generally consumed raw.<br>
