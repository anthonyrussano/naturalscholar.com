## Healing Properties

### Antibiotic

### Antibacterial

### Brain Health

Powerful antioxidant.

#### Cognition

Improves learning and memory functions.[^1]

#### Neuroprotective

Improvings neuronal dysfunctions of the brain.

Walnut Meal Protein protects against neurotoxicity.

Alleviates oxidative stress by suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain.

Reverses **cholinergic dysfunction**

!!! info "Cholinergic dysfunction"
    Altered levels of Acetylcholine (ACh) or modified receptors expression and function, in selected areas of the nervous system, have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington as well as in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.[^2]


## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Infections

Walnut oil can work synergistically with antibiotics to work against resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in vitro.

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

This study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of defatted walnut meal protein hydrolysates (DWMPH) on neurotoxicity induced byD-galactose(D-gal) and aluminum chloride (AlCl3) in mice. The animal models were established by combining treatments withD-gal (200 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) and AlCl3(100 mg/kg in drinking water)for 90 days. During the 90 days, 1 g/kg of DWMPH was administrated orally every day. The results indicated that DWMPH treatment alleviated oxidative stress,  reversed cholinergic dysfunction,and suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brains ofD-gal + AlCl3-treated mice,and thus improving the learning and memory functions of these mice, which was closely correlated with the strong antioxidant activity of DWMPH. This finding suggests that DWMPH might be a promising dietary supplement in improving neuronal dysfunctions of the brain.</i><br>**Link:** [http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/9/2308/pdf](http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/23/9/2308/pdf)<br>**Citations:**

**Abstract:** Acetylcholine (ACh) has been the first molecule to be identified as neurotransmitter. The cholinergic and cholinoceptive areas, both in central and peripheral nervous system, have been well documented. Acetylcholine has been described to control, during embryogenesis, cell proliferation as well as neuron and glial cell survival and differentiation. In the adult, acetylcholine and its receptors are distributed in many tissues other than in the nervous system. More recently, new physiological roles in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues have been proposed for ACh as well as its possible involvement in different pathologies. Altered levels of ACh or modified receptors expression and function, in selected areas of the nervous system, have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington as well as in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Frequently own cognitive, behavioral and motor disabilities that characterize these pathologies are correlated to cholinergic circuit dysfunction. Moreover the involvement of ACh as modulator of the inflammation, in and out of the nervous system, has suggested that its altered functions might represent an additional pathogenetic mechanism negatively influencing the disease outcome as recently suggested in multiple sclerosis. The present review will focus on identifying the cause/effect relationship that may explain the cholinergic dysfunction in several nervous system disorders. Moreover the possible therapeutic novelties including cholinesterase inhibitors, muscarinic agonists and antagonists, and genetic therapy will be discussed.<br>
