## Composition

The green berries contain amino acids, a proteolytic enzyme, condensed tannins, and flavonoids. They contain a high proportion of free amino acids which include proline, valine, tyrosine, alanine, glycine, hydroxyproline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cystine and cysteine. The presence of a proteolytic enzyme, chamase, in the berries may be responsible for the high content of the amino acid.[^1]
