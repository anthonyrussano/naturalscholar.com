# Rosemary

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/rosemary.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">**Rosemary** is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, needle-like leaves and white, pink, purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region. The plant can live as long as 30 years.

**Scientific Name:** Salvia rosmarinus.  Until 2017, it was known by the scientific name Rosmarinus officinalis.

## Composition

Rosemary contains a number of phytochemicals, including rosmarinic acid, camphor, caffeic acid, ursolic acid, betulinic acid, carnosic acid, and carnosol. Rosemary essential oil contains 10–20% camphor.

## Healing Properties

### Antimicrobial

(anti-microbial)

#### Antibiolm activity

### Antiepileptic

anticonvulsant activity against seizures.[^1]

### Antimutagenic

> Antimutagens are agents that protect DNA from harmful mutations.


### Antioxidant

### Antiparkinson’s

The compound carnosol (from Rosemary) significantly protected brain cells from neurotoxicity and improved the cell viability.

### Antidepressant

Involvement of GABAA receptors has been explained as a possible mode of action for inhibition.[^1]

### Anxiolytic

(anti-anxiety)

### Carminative

(relieves flatulence)

### Circulatory Stimulant

### Healthy Digestion

### Nervine

used to stimulate/relax the nerves.

### Brain Health

#### Mental Stimulation

**Stimulant:** Three compounds (cirsimaritin, rosmanol and salvigenin) demonstrated central nervous system stimulant activity.[^1]

#### Memory enhancer** 

(nootropic)

#### Neuroprotective

Rosemary leaf extract improves tolerance against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to the brain tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen).[^1]

### Metabolism

Rosemary Extract improves metabolic abnormalities

Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. Three doses decreased body weight gain, decreased changes in lipid profile (due to increased food intake), improved Fasting Blood Glucose levels, leptin level, and mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP). Overall helped regulate glucose hemostasis in the liver.[^3]

Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiaceae) is an aromatic plant that has been traditionally and medicinally used as a carminative, antispasmodic, painkiller, circulatory tonic, to stimulate hair growth and to improve memory dysfunction. This study aimed to assess the potential effects of rosemary solvent extracts on human immune function. Science Direct, Web of Science, Wiley, Elsevier, PubMed, Scopus, and the Google scholar search engines were used to retrieve relevant information included combinations of “rosemary” or “R. officinalis” with “immune function,” “immunity,” “immune system,” “anti‐inflammatory,” “inflammation,” or “health benefit.” A number of studies have been found a stimulatory effect of rosemary and its active compounds on the immune system in vitro and animal study, but there is a lack of evidence in humans for supporting this. The results demonstrated the potential of rosemary and its main active components as dietary ingredients with immunomodulatory functionality. Human studies should be performed and a double‐blind randomized controlled trial would be ideal.</i><br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcqNQhtry9WzpEdqJgNiXbBGSJgb91jR6VrnADsyDWcoR)

**Abstract:** Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic medication, has been associated with weight gain and metabolic toxicity, especially in long term usage. Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. In this experiment, the effect of CA on olanzapine-induced obesity and metabolic toxicity has been evaluated. Female Wistar rats were divided into six groups. (1) control; (2) olanzapine (5 mg/kg/day, IP); (3, 4 and 5) olanzapine (5 mg/kg/day, IP) plus CA (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day, gavage) and (6) CA (20 mg/kg/day, gavage). Bodyweight and food intake were measured during the study. After 14 days, mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), glycemia, serum lipid profile, the serum concentration of leptin, insulin, AMPK, P-AMPK, and P-ACC liver protein levels were evaluated. The mean weight in the group received olanzapine increased by 4.8 g at the end of the study. The average food intake was increased by olanzapine. Olanzapine increased triglyceride, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and leptin levels. It increased MSBP and down-regulated P-AMPK/AMPK ratio and P-ACC protein levels. CA (three doses) decreased body weight gain and reduced average food intake at 10 and 20 mg/kg. CA especially at the highest dose decreased the changes in lipid profile, FBG, leptin level, and MSBP. P-AMPK/AMPK and P-ACC protein levels were increased by carnosic acid. In conclusion, the activation of AMPK by CA can be proposed as a key mechanism against olanzapine-induced metabolic toxicity where the activation of AMPK increases fat consumption and regulates glucose hemostasis in the liver.<br>
