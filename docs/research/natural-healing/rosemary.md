## Healing Properties

### Antimicrobial

(anti-microbial)

#### Antibiolm activity



### Antiepileptic

anticonvulsant activity against seizures.[^1]

### Antimutagenic

> Antimutagens are agents that protect DNA from harmful mutations.



### Antioxidant

### Antiparkinson’s

The compound carnosol (from Rosemary) significantly protected brain cells from neurotoxicity and improved the cell viability.

### Antidepressant

Involvement of GABAA receptors has been explained as a possible mode of action for inhibition.[^1]

### Anxiolytic

(anti-anxiety)

### Carminative

(relieves flatulence)

### Circulatory Stimulant

### Healthy Digestion

### Nervine

used to stimulate/relax the nerves.

### Brain Health

#### Mental Stimulation

**Stimulant:** Three compounds (cirsimaritin, rosmanol and salvigenin) demonstrated central nervous system stimulant activity.[^1]

#### Memory enhancer** 

(nootropic)

#### Neuroprotective

Rosemary leaf extract improves tolerance against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to the brain tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen).[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Colds/Flu

### Fungal Infections

Ahmed, Muhammed Babakir-Mina<br>**Institution(s):** Sulaimani Polytechnic University, Slemani, Kurdistan Region, Iraq; Newcasle Center For Natural Therapy, Ranya, Slemani, Kurdistan Region, Iraq; Community Health Department, Technical College of Health, Sulaimani Polytechnic University, Slemani, Iraq<br>**Abstract:** <i>The discovery of new curative drugs and the consumption of natural dietary ingredients with the ability to exhibit immunomodulatory activity is urgently needed to decrease the risk of chronic diseases among the population. Rosmarinus officinalis (Lamiaceae) is an aromatic plant that has been traditionally and medicinally used as a carminative, antispasmodic, painkiller, circulatory tonic, to stimulate hair growth and to improve memory dysfunction. This study aimed to assess the potential effects of rosemary solvent extracts on human immune function. Science Direct, Web of Science, Wiley, Elsevier, PubMed, Scopus, and the Google scholar search engines were used to retrieve relevant information included combinations of “rosemary” or “R. officinalis” with “immune function,” “immunity,” “immune system,” “anti‐inflammatory,” “inflammation,” or “health benefit.” A number of studies have been found a stimulatory effect of rosemary and its active compounds on the immune system in vitro and animal study, but there is a lack of evidence in humans for supporting this. The results demonstrated the potential of rosemary and its main active components as dietary ingredients with immunomodulatory functionality. Human studies should be performed and a double‐blind randomized controlled trial would be ideal.</i><br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcqNQhtry9WzpEdqJgNiXbBGSJgb91jR6VrnADsyDWcoR)
