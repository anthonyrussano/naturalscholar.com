<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_200,f_auto/healing-items/green tea.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">**Green Tea** (Camellia sinensis)

## Composition

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Green Tea contains antioxidants.[^5] [^6]

### Skin Health

#### UV Protection

Green tea polyphenols were shown to reduce UV light-induced oxidative stress and immunosuppression.[^5]

Topical treatment and oral consumption of green tea polyphenols (GTP) inhibits chemical carcinogen-or UV radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis.[^5]

### Anti-Obesity

#### Anorexigenic

Reduces appetite, resulting in lower food consumption, leading to weight loss.[^2]
- EGCG & caffeine induces not only suppression of fat accumulation but also strong anorexigenic action.
- The anorexigenic effect may be brought about via inhibiting gastric motility.
- The combination of EGCG also suppresses body weight gain and fat accumulation.[^2]

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Anticholinesterase)

Green tea is known for its high content in tannins.  These tannins greatly inhibit Acetylcholinesterase activity.

- Green Tea tannins inhibit the acetylcholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine, thereby increases both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.[^1]
- There is a strong positive correlation between anticholinesterase activity and total condensed tannins.

    Green Tea Extract Improves Heart Muscle and May Help Treat Cardiomyopathies by Improving Mitochondrial Function

    Previous studies have shown long-term in vivo administration of green tea catechin extract (GTE) resulted in an improvement of heart cell mechanical properties measured by a significant increase in hyperdynamic cardiomyocyte contractility (an increase in the rate of shortening and re-lengthening of heart muscle cells, more specifically the fraction of shortening due to the amplitude of calcium transient, and the rate of cytosolic calcium removal). In this study, cellular bioenergetics was found to be significantly improved by measuring the maximal mitochondrial respiration rate and the cellular ATP level. Notably, the improvement of mitochondrial function was associated with increased levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, whereas the cellular mitochondrial mass was unchanged. GTE supplementation improved cardiomyocyte mechanics and intracellular calcium dynamics, by lowering the expression of total phospholamban (PLB), which led to an increase of both the phosphorylated-PLB/PLB and the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase/PLB ratios. These findings suggest that GTE might be a valuable adjuvant tool for counteracting the occurrence and/or the progression of cardiomyopathies in which mitochondrial dysfunction and alteration of intracellular calcium dynamics constitute early pathogenic factors.

#### Endothelial Health

The molecule [EGCG](../epigallocatechin-gallate) has the ability to bind to proteins found in plaques linked to coronary artery disease and make them more soft and pliable making it easier for blood to flow through arteries and veins.[^1]

### Skin Health

    Green Tea's Anti-skin aging activities are three-fold

    Green tea extract (composed mainly of epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate) has shown positive activities against skin aging, including significant suppression of melanin production, potent antioxidant activities, and significant matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) inhibition (MMP2 is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of the extracellular collagen matrix). The study results have shown that green tea is a functional plant for utilisation as an anti-skin aging agent in the natural remedies, including food, health, and cosmetic products.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

Green tea extract contains catechins which have anti-diabetic properties.[^4]

#### Glucose Regulation

(Carbohydrate Digestion, Glucosidase inhibitor) The Catechins within Green Tea Extract exhibit a potent inhibition of α-glucosidase activity and moderate inhibition on α-amylase (these are glucosidases required for starch digestion). The overall effect of inhibition is to help reduce the flow of glucose from complex dietary carbohydrates into the bloodstream, diminishing the postprandial effect of starch consumption on blood glucose levels.[^4]

### Infections

Camellia sinensis extract shows high antibacterial activity against gram positive bacteria.[^3]

### Heart Disease

Helps reduce the Risk of Heart Attack.

#### Cardiomyapthy

Stewart, Sheena E. Radford, David Rochester, and David A. Middleton<br>**Institutions:** Lancaster University, United Kingdom, Emory University, United States, University of Leeds, United Kingdom, Chemistry, Lancaster University, United Kingdo <br>**Publication:** <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i><br>**Date:** May 31, 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Amyloid deposits of wild-type apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the main protein component of high-density lipoprotein, accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques where they may contribute to coronary artery disease by increasing plaque burden and instability. Using CD analysis, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and transmission EM, we report here a surprising cooperative effect of heparin and the green tea polyphenol (–)- epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known inhibitor and modulator of amyloid formation, on apoA-I fibrils. We found that heparin, a proxy for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides that co-localize ubiquitously with amyloid in vivo, accelerates the rate of apoA-I formation from monomeric protein and associates with insoluble fibrils. Mature, insoluble apoA-I fibrils bound EGCG (KD = 30 ± 3 μM; Bmax = 40 ± 3 μM), but EGCG did not alter the kinetics of apoA-I amyloid assembly from monomer in the presence or absence of heparin. EGCG selectively increased the mobility of specific backbone and side-chain sites of apoA-I fibrils formed in the absence of heparin, but the fibrils largely retained their original morphology and remained insoluble. By contrast, fibrils formed in the presence of heparin were mobilized extensively by the addition of equimolar EGCG, and the fibrils were remodeled into soluble 20-nm-diameter oligomers with a largely α-helical structure that were nontoxic to human umbilical artery endothelial cells. These results argue for a protective effect of EGCG on apoA-I amyloid associated with atherosclerosis and suggest that EGCG-induced remodeling of amyloid may be tightly regulated by GAGs and other amyloid co-factors in vivo, depending on EGCG bioavailability.</i><br>**Link:** [http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA118.002038](http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA118.002038)<br>**Citations:**

The 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine group showed the strongest suppression of food intake and a remarkable reduction of body weight and fat accumulation; therefore, the ratio was determined to be the optimal combination ratio. Moreover, serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level and hypothalamic gene expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) were promoted by 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine. In conclusion, the combined treatment of 0.1% EGCG + 0.1% caffeine induces not only suppression of fat accumulation but also strong anorexigenic action in mice. The anorexigenic effect may be brought about via inhibiting gastric motility by GLP-1 and upregulating POMC in the hypothalamus.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.05.030](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.05.030)<br>**Citations:**

In this study, we investigated synergistic antimicrobial activity of Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia which are commonly used plants with different antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial susceptibility of 350 Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains belonging to 10 different bacterial species, was tested against Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia extracts. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution and microbroth dilution assays. Plant extracts were tested for synergistic antimicrobial activity with different antimicrobial agents by checkerboard titration, Etest/agar incorporation assays, and time kill kinetics. Extract treated and untreated bacteria were subjected to transmission electron microscopy to see the effect on bacterial cell morphology. Camellia sinensis extract showed higher antibacterial activity against MDR S. Typhi, alone and in combination with nalidixic acid, than to susceptible isolates.” We further explore anti-staphylococcal activity of Juglans regia that lead to the changes in bacterial cell morphology indicating the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria as possible target of action. The synergistic combination of Juglans regia and oxacillin reverted oxacillin resistance of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in vitro. This study provides novel information about antimicrobial and synergistic activity of Camellia sinensis and Juglans regia against MDR pathogens</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118431](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118431)<br>**Citations:**

The abundant flavan-3-ol monomers (catechins) in these extracts were also tested for their inhibitory potential and evaluated against the pharmacological glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. To evaluate relative potency of these extracts and catechins, the concentrations required for 50 and 90% inhibition of enzyme activity were determined. Maximum enzyme inhibition was used to assess an inhibitor’s relative efficacy. Results showed that grape seed extract strongly inhibited both α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity, with equal and much higher potency, respectively, than acarbose. While tea extracts and individual catechin 3-gallates were less effective inhibitors of α-amylase, they were potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase. Our data show that plant extracts containing catechin 3-gallates are potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase, and suggest that procyanidins found in grape seed extract strongly inhibit α-amylase activity.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301147n)<br>**Citations:**   

[^5]: **Study Type:** Preprint: Review Paper<br>**Title:** An extensive Review of Sunscreen and Suntan Preparations<br>**Author(s):** AK Mohiuddin<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Pharmacy, World University of Bangladesh; 151/8, Green Road, Dhanmondi, Dhaka –1205, Bangladesh<br>**Publication:** <i>Preprint</i><br>**Date:** April 2019<br>**Abstract:** <i>The sunscreen industry is achieving remarkable worldwide prominence by responding to the growing need for skin protection with fast-paced innovation. Increased consumer awareness of the harmful effects of sunlight has fueled the demand for improved photo protection. The need for broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays has inspired scientists worldwide to research new cosmetic formulations and delivery systems. More effective sunscreen actives, emollients and novel cosmetic and functional ingredients have been regularly added to the formulator’s repertoire. Creativity in innovation has been hindered only by regulatory agencies and patent restrictions worldwide. Familiarity with the current restrictive regulations and patent law infringements has become integral to any research effort attempting to provide improved protection to individuals affected by the sun’s damaging effects. The increasing incidence of skin cancers and photo damaging effects caused by ultraviolet radiation has increased the use of sun screening agents, which have shown beneficial effects in reducing the symptoms and reoccurrence of these problems. Unlike the situation in Europe where sunscreen ingredients are considered under cosmetics guidelines, the FDA is required to define sunscreens as drugs since they are advertised to prevent sunburn and, more recently, the risk of skin cancer. In the USA, the FDA has been regulating this industry since August 25, 1978, with the publication of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Sunscreens are considered drugs and cosmetics and therefore must be governed by the FDA-OTC monograph. With the variety of sunscreen agents used in cosmetic and UV protection products, Australia, Canada, and the European Union (EU) have also developed regulatory protocols on safe sunscreen product use. Unlike the USA though, Australia has approved 34 active sunscreen ingredients and the EU has approved 28 of these ingredients. Current FDA regulations allow labeling of sunscreen products to a maximum of 30þ, despite the many products currently available with numbers as high as 100. From a cosmetic formulation point of view, increasing the SPF number in a product is governed by simple chemical principles.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201904.0327/v1/download)<br>**Citations:**
