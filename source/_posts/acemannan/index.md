**Acemannan** (ACE) is a polysaccharide (carbohydrate) located within the soft pulp of the inner leaves of Aloe plants. Many of the beneficial properties of Aloe have been attributed to the acemannan present in the gel. 

## Composition

Acemannan is a β(1,4)-acetylated mannan-based polysaccharide derived from the plant aloe vera (Barbadensis milleri).

## Healing Properties

Acemannan has potential immunostimulant, antiviral, antineoplastic, and gastrointestinal properties.

### Anti-aphthous activity

Helps prevent/treat aphthous ulcers (small, shallow sores inside the mouth or at the base of the gums).[^4]

### Antiviral

[^3]

### Antineoplastic

Helps prevent, inhibit or halt the development of a neoplasm (a tumor).[^1]

### Bone Health

(Skeletal Health)

#### Osteogenic

Promotes the functioning of osteogenesis (i.e. producing bone)

#### Bone Regeneration

Acemannan, a β-(1–4)-acetylated polymannose extracted from Aloe vera gel, has been proposed as biomaterial for bone regeneration.[^1]

- Acemannan is an effective bioactive agent for bone regeneration, enhancing bone growth as assayed in two- and three-dimensions.[^1]
- Treatment with Acemannan for calvarial (skullcap, or the upper part of the neurocranium which covers the cranial cavity containing the brain) defect healing showed a significant increase in bone surface and bone volume and tissue mineral density. The acemannan-treated groups also had a denser bone matrix.[^1]

### Gastrointestinal Health

### Immunostimulant

### Oral Health

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

Acemannan is degraded by the intestinal microbiota to form oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides inhibit intestinal glucose absorption.[^2]

#### Glucose Regulation

Acemannan treatment promotes a significant reduction in blood glucose.[^2]

#### Blood Pressure

Acemannan treatment promotes a significant reduction in blood pressure.[^2]

#### Lipid Profile Regulation

Acemannan treatment promotes improvement of the lipid profile.[^2]

### Viral Infections

#### HIV

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acemannan in calvarial defect healing. Materials and methods: Acemannan was processed to freeze-dried sponge form and disinfected by UV irradiation. Thirty-five female Sprague–Dawley rats were used in the in vivo study. Seven-mm diameter mid-calvarial defects were created and randomly allocated into blood clot control (C), acemannan 1 mg (A1), 2 mg (A2), 4 mg (A4), and 8 mg (A8) groups (n = 7). After four weeks, the calvarial specimens were subjected to microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histopathological analysis. Results: MicroCT revealed a significant increase in bone surface and bone volume in the A1 and A2 groups, and tissue mineral density in the A4 and A8 groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Histologically, the acemannan-treated groups had denser bone matrix compared with the control group. Conclusion: Acemannan is an effective bioactive agent for bone regeneration, enhancing bone growth as assayed in two- and three-dimensions.<br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXj2DpRx5jbxk1K9pgyiRCDz9bpQmRL5mZzjd25YKq4Pj)

Filadelfia, 35010, Gómez Palacio, Durango, México; University of the Balearic Islands, Department of Chemistry, Ctra Valldemossa Km 7.5, 07122, Palma de Mallorca, Spain<br>**Abstract:** Aloe vera (A. barbadensis Miller) is probably one of the most popular plants, widely studied because of numerous properties associated with the polysaccharides present in its gel. In particular, two main types of bioactive polysaccharides can be distinguished in the A. vera gel: an acetylated mannose-rich polymer that functions as storage polysaccharide, and a galacturonic acid–rich polymer as the main component comprising the cell walls of the parenchymatous tissue. Interestingly, most of the beneficial properties related to the aloe plant have been associated with the acetylated mannose-rich polysaccharide, also known as acemannan. However, the composition and structural features of these polysaccharides, as well as the beneficial properties associated with them, may be altered by different factors, such as the climate, soil, postharvest treatments, and processing. Further, different analytical methods have been used not only to identify but also to characterize the main polysaccharides found in parenchyma of A. vera leaf. Within this context, the main aim of this review is to summarize the most relevant information about the structural and compositional features of the main polysaccharides found in the A. vera gel as well as the most relevant analytical techniques used for their identification and their influence on the technological, functional, and beneficial properties related to the A. vera plant.<br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQeGSsPFdHc867mKPRaBem947BCCHWT2bzWHc4yLW1LHB)

Harold Helderman<br>**Institution(s):** Renal Immunology Laboratory, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, U.S.A.<br>**Abstract:** Healing powers have been imputed as being a feature of the gel from the aloe vera plant for centuries. The recent isolation of the active ingredient, acemannan, has made testing of this drug important. Since the drug appears to enhance monocyte function on other experiments, these studies were designed to test the capacity of acemannan to enhance immune response to alloantigen and to test whether the potential enhancement is a monocyte driven phenomenon. Acemannan did not enhance lymphocyte response to syngeneic antigens in the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) but importantly increased alloantigenic response in a dose - response fashion (2.6 × 10−7 − 2.6 × 10−9M). This effect of acemannan was shown to be a specific response and to concur with concentrations of in vitro acemannan achievable in vivo. A separate series of mixing experiments demonstrated that acemannan incubation with monocytes permitted monocyte driven signals to enhance T-cell response to lectin. It is concluded that acemannan, the active ingredient of the aloe vera plant, is an important immunoenhancer in that it increases lymphocyte response to alloantigen. It is suggested that the mechanism involves enhancement of monocyte release of IL-I under the aegis of alloantigen. This mechanism may explain in part the recently observed capacity of acemannan to abrogate viral infections in animal and man. <br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfEQ4JV9CKdtvrbAENjx6iCDZmQQFveh2saQVbURx7w8H)

The current study aimed to review the clinical trials on the effectiveness of medicinal plants and their active phytochemicals in the treatment of RAU. Five databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library were searched for retrieving all the relevant clinical trials. The results indicate that a wide range of scientific evidence has approved the therapeutic benefits of natural medicaments in the management of RAU, including Satureja khuzistanica, Aloe vera, Myrrh, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Alchemilla vulgaris, Myrtus communis, Melissa officinalis, Rhizophora mangle, Chamomile, Rosa damascena, Nicotiana tabacum, Punica granatum, Ageratina pichinchensis, Norwegian LongoVital, Lavender oil, and Perilla oil that are known anti-aphthous medical plants. Berberine and acemannan are bioactive substances with diverse pharmacological and therapeutic benefits in patients with aphthous, which made them as the promising alternatives for new pharmacological drugs. This review provides evidence that medicinal plants can be considered as future pharmaceutical drugs or adjuvant treatment with conventional therapeutic approaches to improve their efficacy and alleviate the side effects in the management of RAU. Further clinical studies are also necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of plant-derived natural products with potential effects in treating RAU.<br>[IPFS Link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZVNkrTqcwXEwS5ZcEpUix7NFbisXPrn9dLYE4vRHo9GD)
