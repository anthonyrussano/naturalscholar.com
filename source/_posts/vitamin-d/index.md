**Vitamin D**

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury.[^1]

### Anticancerous

Vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of cancer death by 16%[^2]

Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cancer death by 16%. A total of 75,454 participants were identified. Vitamin D supplementation statistically significantly reduced the risk of cancer death. In subgroup analyses, all cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation.[^2]

#### Skin Health

##### Photoprotective

Vitamin D protects the skin from UV damage by promoting macrophage autophagy (natural, orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components).[^1]

###### UV Radiation Protection

Oral administration of high doses of Vitamin D3: 

- Reduced skin erythema and thickness.
- Increased expression of skin barrier genes, which help to repair the epidermal barrier and attenuate the inflammatory insult.[^1]

Increased consumer awareness of the harmful effects of sunlight has fueled the demand for improved photo protection. The need for broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays has inspired scientists worldwide to research new cosmetic formulations and delivery systems. More effective sunscreen actives, emollients and novel cosmetic and functional ingredients have been regularly added to the formulator’s repertoire. Creativity in innovation has been hindered only by regulatory agencies and patent restrictions worldwide. Familiarity with the current restrictive regulations and patent law infringements has become integral to any research effort attempting to provide improved protection to individuals affected by the sun’s damaging effects. The increasing incidence of skin cancers and photo damaging effects caused by ultraviolet radiation has increased the use of sun screening agents, which have shown beneficial effects in reducing the symptoms and reoccurrence of these problems. Unlike the situation in Europe where sunscreen ingredients are considered under cosmetics guidelines, the FDA is required to define sunscreens as drugs since they are advertised to prevent sunburn and, more recently, the risk of skin cancer. In the USA, the FDA has been regulating this industry since August 25, 1978, with the publication of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Sunscreens are considered drugs and cosmetics and therefore must be governed by the FDA-OTC monograph. With the variety of sunscreen agents used in cosmetic and UV protection products, Australia, Canada, and the European Union (EU) have also developed regulatory protocols on safe sunscreen product use. Unlike the USA though, Australia has approved 34 active sunscreen ingredients and the EU has approved 28 of these ingredients. Current FDA regulations allow labeling of sunscreen products to a maximum of 30þ, despite the many products currently available with numbers as high as 100. From a cosmetic formulation point of view, increasing the SPF number in a product is governed by simple chemical principles.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201904.0327/v1/download)<br>**Citations:**

**Abstract:** Objective To investigate whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with lower mortality in adults. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register from their inception to 26 December 2018. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials comparing vitamin D supplementation with a placebo or no treatment for mortality were included. Independent data extraction was conducted and study quality assessed. A meta-analysis was carried out by using fixed effects and random effects models to calculate risk ratio of death in the group receiving vitamin D supplementation and the control group. Main outcome measures All cause mortality. Results: 50 trials with a total of 74 655 participants were identified. Vitamin D supplementation was not associated with all cause mortality (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.02, I2=0%), cardiovascular mortality (0.98, 0.88 to 1.08, 0%), or non-cancer, non-cardiovascular mortality (1.05, 0.93 to 1.18, 0%). Vitamin D supplementation statistically significantly reduced the risk of cancer death (0.85, 0.74 to 0.97, 0%). In subgroup analyses, all cause mortality was significantly lower in trials with vitamin D3 supplementation than in trials with vitamin D2 supplementation (P for interaction=0.04); neither vitamin D3 nor vitamin D2 was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all cause mortality. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation alone was not associated with all cause mortality in adults compared with placebo or no treatment. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of cancer death by 15%. Additional large clinical studies are needed to determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation is associated with lower all cause mortality.<br>
