holistic appraisal<br>**Author(s):** Damini Kothari, Seema Patel, Soo-Ki Kim<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Animal Science and Technology, Konkuk University, 120 Neungdong-ro, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea, Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics Research Center, San Diego State University, San Diego, 92182, USA<br>**Publication:** <i>Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy</i><br>**Date:** September 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>The discovery of nutritious dietary supplements and side effect-free therapeutics are a priority in the current scenario of increasing instances of metabolic syndromes. In this direction, mushroom polysaccharides have shown immense promise. Scores of studies have characterized and evaluated their biological relevance, which range from antioxidant, Antiinflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and antilipemic to immunomodulatory. Hence, it is important to accumulate the key findings of these investigations, and to apply the insights to develop functional foods, and immunomodulators. This review attempts to meet this goal by gleaning the key discoveries on mushroom polysaccharides in the recent years, and to present them in a comprehensive manner. With this objective, the physiological relevance of the polysaccharides, the underlying mechanism, and hurdles in the path of their therapeutics transition, have been discussed. Finally, critical comments have been made to expedite research in this area.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2018.05.138)<br>**Citations:**

Due to its high quality of proteins, polysaccharides, unsaturated fatty acids, mineral substances, triterpenes sterols and secondary metabolites, mushrooms have always been appreciated for their vital role in protecting and curing various health problems, such as immunodeficiency, cancer, inflammation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and obesity. Moreover, investigations in recent years have revealed the correlations between the health-promoting benefits and gut microbiota regulating effects induced by the mushrooms intake. Researches on the immense role in the nutritional and health benefits displayed by mushrooms have become an emergent task to study. The present article overviewed and compiled the latest information correlated to the health benefits and underlying functional mechanisms of mushroom nutraceuticals, and concluded that the supplementation of mushrooms as a dietary composition could become a natural adjuvant for the prevention and treatment of several health diseases.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2018.05.002)<br>**Citations:**

The therapeutic effect of Inonotus obliquus polysaccharide (IOP) on chronic pancreatitis (CP) in mice has been validated in our previous study. However, it is not clear whether IOP is conducive to maintaining the homeostasis between gut microbiota and host. The aim of this study is to testify the potential effects of IOP on gut microbiota composition and diversity in mice with CP. The changes in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), lipase and trypsin levels were measured by commercial assay kits, meanwhile the gut microbiota composition and diversity were analyzed by high throughput sequencing. The IOP treatment increased GSH-PX and TAOC levels, and decreased TNF-α, TGF-β, lipase and trypsin levels in CP mice. It was also observed that gut microbiota in IOP treated groups were less diverse than others in terms of lower Shannon diversity index and Chao 1 estimator. IOP increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes and decreased that of Firmicutes at phylum level. Bacteroidetes was found positively correlated with GSH-PX and TAOC, and Firmicutes correlated with TNF-α, TGF-β, and lipase. In conclusion, administration of IOP could regulate gut microbiota composition and diversity to a healthy profile in mice with CP, and some bacterial phylum significantly correlated with characteristic parameters.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13568-017-0341-1)<br>**Citations:**
