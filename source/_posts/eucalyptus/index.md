## Healing Properties

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Parasites:**
  - **Toxoplasmosis:** Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii).  Eucalyptus may be a useful candidate for treating Toxoplasma infection.[^1]
    - The increased weight of liver and spleen, due to infection, was reduced by treatments.[^1]
    - Eucalyptus possess anti-T. gondii activities in vitro and in vivo, in addition, Eucalyptus shows antioxidant activity.[^1]

However, this treatment presents several adverse side effects; Thus, new drugs with lower toxicities are urgently needed. In this study the anti-T. gondii activity of A. vera and Eucalyptus extracts were evaluated in vitro using a MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and in vivo by measuring the survival rates of mice infected with 2 × 103 tachyzoites of RH strain of T. gondii and then injected intraperitoneally by different concentrations of extracts for 4 days. Biochemical parameters such as Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Potential (FRAP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) assay were also evaluated. As results, in the in vitro assay, the IC50 values were 13.2, 24.7, 2.63 μg/ml, and the selectivity indexes were 3.3, 2.4, 3.03 for the A. vera, Eucalyptus and pyrimethamine, respectively. The mice treated with Eucalyptus showed a better survival rate than others (P < 0.05). The increased weight of liver and spleen, due to infection, was reduced by treatments. In FRAP assay Eucalyptus showed a better antioxidant activity than the other extracts. MDA levels in both liver and spleen were reduced by treatment. The results show that A. Vera and Eucalyptus possess anti-T. gondii activities in vitro and in vivo, in addition, Eucalyptus shows antioxidant activity with a higher survival rate. Therefore, Eucalyptus may be a useful candidate for treating Toxoplasma infection. Moreover, further studies are required to investigate the fractionations of this plant against T. gondii.</i><br>**Link:** []()<br>**Citations:**
