**Beta-glucans (β-Glucans)** are naturally occurring in the cell walls of cereals, bacteria, and fungi, with radically different physicochemical properties dependent on their source.  β-Glucans are the most studied immunomodulators with significant synergetic effects with numerous bioactive molecules.[^1]

## Healing Properties

- **Anticancer:** (anticancer)
- **Immunomodulator:** helps regulate or normalize the immune system.

[^1]: **Title:** Combination Therapy with Glucan and Coenzyme Q10 in Murine Experimental Autoimmune Disease and Cancer<br>**Author(s):** VACLAV VETVICKA and JANA VETVICKOVA<br>**Institution(s):** University of Louisville, Department of Pathology, Louisville, KY, U.S.A.<br>**Publication:** <i>International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment</i><br>**Date:** June 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Background/Aim: Coenzyme Q10 is a well-accepted anti-oxidant agent known to play a protective role in various physiological and disease processes. Recently, Coenzyme Q10 is gaining attention as a substance with significant Antiinflammatory properties. β-Glucan is the most studied immunomodulator with significant synergetic effects with numerous bioactive molecules. We aimed to evaluate the possible synergistic effects of simultaneous use of coenzyme Q10 with the well-established immune modulator, β-glucan, on immune reactions and cancer development. Materials and Methods: Coenzyme Q10 and β-glucan were used, both in vivo and in vitro, and their effects were evaluated using phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Results: Our study confirmed the strong Antiinflammatory effects of coenzyme Q10 and showed that these effects were further potentiated with the addition of β-glucan. The anticancer effects of coenzyme Q10 were less pronounced, but stronger, with the addition of β-glucan. Conclusion: There is significant synergy between coenzyme Q10 and β-glucan.</i><br>**Link:** [http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/38/6/3291.full](http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/38/6/3291.full)<br>**Citations:**
