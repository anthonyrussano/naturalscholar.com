**Bananas** are the leading fruit produced and consumed globally, and are an important source of carbohydrate energy, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and other micronutrients.[^2]

## Healing Properties

- **Antiinflammatory:** Ingesting Bananas and Water before an exercise bout, helps attenuate the post-exercise increase in oxidized linoleic acid metabolites.[^1]
  - *Inflammatory processes are elevated during recovery from intensive and long-duration exercise.*[^1]
  - Carbohydrate intake, such as that from bananas, help provide enhanced glucose availability to the working muscles, resulting in reduced post-exercise cortisol and epinephrine levels, decreased leukocytosis and phagocytosis, and lower inflammatory cytokines.[^1]
  - Reduces reliance on glycolysis for ATP production.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

- **Diabetes:** Reduces reliance on glycolysis for ATP production.[^1]

[^1]: **Title:** Influence of Carbohydrate Ingestion from Bananas or Sugar Beverage on 9- and 13-Hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9 + 13 HODE) During Recovery from 75-km Cycling<br>**Author(s):** David C. Nieman, Nicholas D. Gillitt, Kevin J. Knagge, Huiyuan Chen, Courtney L. Goodman, Christopher R. Capps, Zachary L. Shue, and Nicole Heyl<br>**Institution(s):** Appalachian State University, Kannapolis, NC; Dole Nutrition Research Laboratory, Kannapolis, NC; David H. Murdock Research Institute, Kannapolis, NC<br>**Publication:** <i>The Federation Of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal</i><br>**Date:** 1 Apr 2017<br>**Abstract:** <i>Linoleic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), is the direct precursor to oxidized linoleic acid metabolites (OXLAMs) including 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9 + 13 HODE). 9 + 13 HODE are stable and abundant oxidation products in plasma, play a role in the regulation of inflammatory processes, and are elevated during recovery from intensive and long-duration exercise. Carbohydrate intake has multiple benefits for the exercising athlete, including enhanced glucose availability to the working muscle, resulting in reduced post-exercise cortisol and epinephrine levels, decreased leukocytosis and phagocytosis, and lower inflammatory cytokines. The effect of carbohydrate intake on post-exercise HODEs is unknown, and the purpose of this study was to compare ingestion of Cavendish bananas with an equicaloric, sugar-only beverage or water alone on plasma 9 + 13 HODE levels during recovery from an intensive 75-km cycling bout (183.9±5.8 min across all trials). Participants included 16 male and female cyclists (age 39.9±2.4 years) who regularly competed in road races and were capable of cycling 75-km at race pace. This study utilized a randomized crossover approach, and participants engaged in three 75-km cycling time trials while ingesting water only, bananas and water, and a 6% sugar beverage in an overnight fasted state, with data analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), within subjects approach. Before the exercise bout, participants ingested 5 ml/kg water alone, or the 6% sugar beverage or Cavendish banana (with water) adjusted to quantities providing 0.4 g carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight (g carb/kg). During the cycling bout, water was ingested at a rate of 3 ml/kg every 15 minutes, with carbohydrate intake from the 6% sugar beverage and banana adjusted to 0.2 g carb/kg every 15 minutes. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-exercise, and then at 1.5 h and 21 h post-exercise. Detection of plasma 9 + 13 HODE was conducted on an UPLC system coupled with Quattro Premier XE MS (Waters, Milford, MA) operated in electrospray ionization (ESI) negative mode. The overall pattern of change in 9 + 13 HODE was significantly different between treatment trials (interaction p-value <0.05), with 94%, 63%, and 72% increases immediately post-exercise, and 22%, 4.2%, and 6.8% increases 1.5 h post-exercise in the water alone, banana, and sugar beverage trials, respectively. Plasma 9 + 13 HODE was back to pre-exercise levels in all trials by the next morning (21 h post-exercise). In conclusion, these data indicate that carbohydrate ingestion from bananas with water or a 6% sugar beverage compared to water alone attenuates the post-exercise increase in plasma 9 + 13 HODE following 75-km of intensive cycling in overnight fasted athletes.</i><br>**Link:** [https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.317.1](https://www.fasebj.org/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.31.1_supplement.317.1)<br>**Citations:**
