A plum is a fruit of the subgenus Prunus of the genus Prunus.

## Healing Properties

### Anticancer

Induction of apoptosis & inhibition of migration.[^2]

### Digestion

### Detoxification

Regulations of enzymes involved in detoxification.[^2]

#### Probiotic / Prebiotic

Plum extract has been shown to activate the growth of all lactobacilli strains.[^1]

- Lactobacilli are particularly well-recognized as major contributors to improved gut and overall health.

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

## Cancer

### Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The content of biologically active compounds was determined by thin-layer chromatography. We established the effect of berries and fruits methan extracts on the selected strains L. acidophilus, L. catenaformis, L. casei, L. fermentum, E. coli 058, E. faecalis (gut commensals), B. subtilis 090 (component of biopreparation), which were perspective for the creation of modern pharmabiotics, according to the results of these bacteria cultivation in the specified extracts. It was found that the investigated berry extracts were characterized by a higher content of polyphenols, compared to anthocyanins. Alycha extract mainly inhibited the growth of the most lactobacilli strains that we had tested, except for B. subtilis 090. Extracts of red currant, sweet cherry, and jostaberry stimulated the growth of L. сatenaformis, while extracts of sweet cherry and jostaberry, in addition to that of the above-mentioned lactobacilli strains, also stimulated the growth of L. сasei and L. fermentum. Blueberry and plum extracts activated the growth of all lactobacilli strains. The ability to stimulate the growth of B. subtilis 090 was noted only in the extract of alycha, jostaberry, and plum.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.15407/biotech12.03.067)<br>**Citations:**
