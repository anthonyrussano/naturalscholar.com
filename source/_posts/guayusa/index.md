**Guayusa**

Guayusa (Ilex guayusa Loes.) is grown in the Amazonian territories of southern Colombia, northern Peru, and Ecuador.

## Composition

The main compounds present in the guayusa extracts were caffeine, squalene and -amyrin.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antimicrobial

#### Antifungal

Some extracts obtained from guayusa leaves showed antifungal activity.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

## Adverse Affects

## Synergistic Effects

Guayusa has been consumed for centuries in the western Amazon as an herbal tea, and novel food regulation provide a detailed framework for safety assessment of novel foods with such a history of use. This study reviews guayusa’s taxonomy, chemical composition, toxicology, ethnobotany, and history of safe use as key elements of a robust novel food safety assessment. Guayusa is a product of traditional agricultural systems with a continuous history of consumption in Ecuador. Its known chemical composition appears to present no greater risk to human health than existing teas such as green tea or yerba mate, although our understanding of guayusa’s chemical profile is still nascent, requiring further investigation. Broad consumption of guayusa is not associated with a history of adverse effects or product safety notifications. Biochemical and phytochemical studies have profiled its nutritional content, metabolite composition, and bioactivity, validating guayusa’s antioxidant and stimulant properties. In conclusion, guayusa leaves have a well-documented chemical composition and history of safe use, which are key considerations for authorization as a novel food in the EU.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2019.1643286)<br>**Citations:**
