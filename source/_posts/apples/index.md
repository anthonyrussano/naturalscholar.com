Apples (Malus domestica) are one of the most significant fruits in all of the world.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Many types of antioxidant compounds are present in apple fruit and apple peels.[^1]

Apples contain a large number, and high levels, of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity.[^1]

Polyphenols are the chief antioxidant biomolecules contained in apples. There is a correlation between the content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity among all the varieties of apple.[^1]

### Antimicrobial

#### Antiviral

##### Anti-influenza (flu virus)

### Hepatoprotective (antihepatotoxicity)

Helps prevent damage to the liver.

Apple polyphenols have the potential to be hepatoprotective and inhibit hepatic steatosis.[^1]

### Reducing cholesterol

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Heart Disease

A reduced risk of cardiovascular disease has been associated with apple consumption especially in women.[^2]

#### Coronary artery disease 

##### Atherosclerosis

Phytosterols in apples have been shown to help prevent coronary atherosclerosis and treat heart disease.[^1]

### Lung Disease

Apple consumption has been positively associated with general pulmonary health.[^2]

#### Asthma

Apple consumption has been inversely linked with asthma.[^2]

Apple and pear intake has been associated with a decreased risk of asthma and a decrease in bronchial hypersensitivity.[^2]

#### Pleuritis (Pleurisy)

Apples have been shown to be effective in pleurisy (inflammation of the tissues that line the lungs and chest cavity).[^2]

#### Dyspnea

Apples have been shown to be effective in treating and preventing dyspnea and shortness of breath.[^2]

### Cough suppressant (anti-cough)

Apple consumption has been shown to be effective in treating and preventing coughing.[^2]

### Acute respiratory infection

Apples are a medicinal food with therapeutic effect in treating infections of the respiratory tract.[^2]

#### Covid-19 (Novel Coronavirus)
Apples have been considered as part of a therapeutic diet appropriate to help treat respiratory infections similar to COVID-19.[^2]

## Composition

A large number of bioactive substances including polyphenols, polysaccharides, plant sterols, pentacyclic triterpenes, and organic acids have been found in apples.[^1]

Apples contains zinc.[^1]

Apples contain phytosterols such as sitosterol and daucosterol.[^1]

## Cultivars

There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Here are some of the most popular:

### Alice

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/alice apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Lady Alice apples were discovered in 1979 at an orchard near Gleed, Washington, as a chance seedling and is a registered trademark by the Rainier Fruit Company. It is named after Alice Zirkle, a co-founder of the company. The Lady Alice apple has a dense and crispy texture and a rich heirloom-like complex flavor, sweet with hints of tart. It is typically stored after harvest and sold to the retail customer at the flavor's peak. It is suitable for fresh eating as a snack, as well as for cooking and baking. Among its specialty characteristics is that it does not brown quickly even if cut open, and keeps shape and texture at high temperature baking. Lady Alice is distinguished from other cultivars with its pink blush over creamy-yellow background; the background color darkens after harvest.

### Ambrosia

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/ambrosia apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Ambrosia apples originated in British Columbia in the early 1990s. The fruit is medium to large, weighing about 215 grams, and has mostly red, glossy colouration, with yellow patches. It has cream-coloured, firm meat with a sweet flavour reminiscent of pear and low acidity. Ambrosia is most common in British Columbia, where it was discovered, and is the third most produced apple in the province. It is also being produced in Ontario and Nova Scotia, as well as many other places around the world. Parentage is suspected to be 'Starking Delicious' × 'Golden Delicious' because those apples existed in the orchard where the 'Ambrosia' was discovered growing.

### Ananasrenette

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/ananasrenette apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Ananas Reinette (Pineapple rennet) is a golden, spotted, russeted heirloom apple known for its crisp and juicy flesh with a distinctive pineapple taste.

Some trace it back to 1820s Netherlands, and others as far back as 16th Century France. Ananas Reinette translates to “Royal Pineapple.”

### Arkansas Black

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/arkansas black apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">The Arkansas Black apple originated in the mid-19th Century in Benton County, Arkansas. These apples are generally medium-sized with a somewhat flattened shape. Very dark red on the tree, occasionally with a slight green blush where hidden from the sun, the apples grow darker as they ripen, becoming a very dark red or burgundy color. With storage the skin continues to darken. Arkansas Black is one of the darkest of all apple cultivars. The flesh is notably hard and crunchy when fresh, though it does soften somewhat with keeping. Fairly tart when fresh-picked, the apples mellow with storage. Arkansas Blacks are considered an excellent keeping apple, and can be stored for six months in appropriate conditions. The cultivar is grown throughout the United States.

### Aroma

There are many variants: Boskoop red, yellow or green. This rustic apple is firm, tart and fragrant. Greenish-gray tinged with red, the apple stands up well to cooking. Generally Boskoop varieties are very high in acid content and can contain more than four times the vitamin C of 'Granny Smith' or 'Golden Delicious'. The apple grows well in Normandy, France.

### Bramley

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/bramley apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Bramley's apple is usually eaten cooked due to its sourness. Some people eat this apple raw in order to cleanse the palate, but Bramley's seedling is essentially the fruit for tart, pie, or dumpling. Once cooked, however, it has a lighter flavour. When cooked it becomes golden and fluffy. The apples are very large, two or three times the weight of a typical dessert apple. They are flat with a vivid green skin which becomes red on the side which receives direct sunlight.

### Cox's Orange Pippin

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/alchemist-cookbook/image/upload/w_100,f_auto/healing-items/cox orange pippin apple.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px; float:left; margin: 5px;">Cox's Orange Pippin, often referred to simply as Cox, is an apple cultivar first grown in 1830, at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, England, by the retired brewer and horticulturist Richard Cox. The parentage of the cultivar is unknown. 'Cox's Orange Pippin' is highly regarded due to its excellent flavour and attractive appearance. The apples are of medium size, orange-red in colour, deepening to bright red and mottled with carmine over a deep yellow background. The flesh is very aromatic, yellow-white, fine-grained, crisp, and very juicy. Cox's flavour is sprightly subacid, with hints of cherry and anise, becoming softer and milder with age.
