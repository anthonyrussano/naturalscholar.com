**Blueberries** (Cyanococcus Vaccinium) are all native to North America, and were introduced into Europe in the 1930s.

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

Free radical scavenging.[^2]

### Brain Health

The polyphenols and other phytochemicals contained in blueberries can be detected all throughout the brain.[^1]

### Anti-glycation

Glycation is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD, where it potentiates the aggregation and toxicity of proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ).

### Brain Plasticity

modulates synaptic plasticity.

### Improves cognition

(Prevents cognitive decline) Extract from grape & blueberry attenuates cognitive decline and improves neuronal function.[^1]

### Microglial Neuroprotective

Microglia are a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. Microglia account for 10–15% of all cells found within the brain. Microglia act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system.

- Polyphenol & anthocyanin-enriched extracts of berries help protect the brain's microglia.
- Decreases cytotoxicity in microglia.

### Neurogenesis

promotes the growth of newly generated neurons![^1]

### Digestion

Helps cleanse the deep pockets of the intestines.

### Gut Health

#### Probiotic / Prebiotic

There are compounds of anthocyanins in the extracts of blueberries that have probacterial (probiotic) properties.[^3]

- Blueberry extract has been shown to activate the growth of all lactobacilli strains.[^3]
  - Lactobacilli are particularly well-recognized as major contributors to improved gut and overall health.

### Cardioprotective

Wild blueberry extracts (which have a significantly higher phenolic content compared to commercial blueberries) have been shown to attenuate cardiac cell damage (cardiomyocytes) through reduction in oxidative stress and apoptosis.[^4]

A blueberry-enriched diet has been shown to protect the myocardium from induced ischemic damage and demonstrated the potential to attenuate the development of post myocardial infarction chronic heart failure.[^5]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

### Age-induced cognitive decline

### Azheimer's Disease

### Memory deficits (impaired memory)

### Metabolic disorders

### Type 2 Diabetes

Prevents Ameloydβeta fibrillation.

Improves glucose regulation.
