**Avocado** (Persea Americana Mill.) is a native fruit of Central and South America.[^1]

## Composition

Avocados are rich in fat (approximately 15% by wt.).[^1]

Avocados contain predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA; 9.6% by wt.), which represent 62.8% to 63.6% of the total fatty acids found in avocados, with a predominance of oleic acid.[^1]

The oil consists of approximately 71% MUFAs, 13% polyunsaturated fatty acids, 16% saturated fatty acids, fiber, vitamin B, vitamin K1, vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids, phenolics, and phytosterols.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Antiinflammatory

Chronic avocado oil ingestion reduces C-reactive protein.[^2]

### Antioxidant

Avocado oil has a wide variety of lipophilic antioxidants, which may decrease ROS production in renal mitochondria.[^1]

### Blood Health

Chronic avocado pulp treatment improves anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic activities.[^2]

There are acute benefcial properties of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acid from avocado on glycemic and vascular markers during an acute postprandial challenge in middle-aged, overweight or obese subjects.[^2]

#### Cholesterol Levels

The high concentrations of MUFAs in avocado suggest that an avocado-rich diet results in beneficial effects on blood lipids.[^1]

Chronic avocado oil ingestion reduced triglycerides and LDL and VLDL cholesterol.[^2]

The inclusion of one fresh avocado per day in a moderately fatty diet supports an improvement in cholesterol levels.[^2]

#### High Cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia)

8 weeks supplementation with avocado oil (450 and 900 mg/kg/day) partially improved the lipid profile (lower LDL and triglycerides and higher HDL) and increased the activity of the Krebs cycle.[^1]

### Antiobesity

Supplementation with hydroalcoholic extracts of the fruit (100-mg/kg body weight) for 12 weeks reduced weight gain (24.77%) and BMI (17.92%).[^1]

### Insulen sensitivity

Body weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity were observed in rats fed a sucrose-rich diet and supplemented with 10–30% avocado oil for
8 weeks.[^1]

### Heart Health

Chronic ingestion of aqueous avocado leaf extract is benefcial in improving cardiovascular parameters.[^2]

#### Blood Pressure

Chronic avocado oil consumption has beneficial effects on cardiovascular physiology, including lowered systemic blood pressure, reduced renal reactive oxygen species, improved renal endothelium-dependent vasodilation and kidney mitochondrial function, suggesting that avocado positively interacts with the angiotensin system in regulating blood pressure.[^2]

#### Heart Disease

##### Atherosclerosis

Decreases the risk of atherogenic plaque formation.[^1]

#### Exercise

Avocado pulp prior to aerobic exercise improves a number of cardiovascular and autonomic variables during recovery in healthy females.[^2] This outcome supports the advantageous efects of avocado pulp prior to exertion, suggesting the benefcial use of avocado before exercise.[^2]

### Liver Health

Treatment with an aqueous extract of avocado (100 and 200 mg/kg) protects against hepatic toxicity.[^1]

- It reduces the activity of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and serum alanine aminotransferase and decreased serum bilirubin levels.[^1]

### Kidney Health

Chronic avocado oil consumption reduced renal reactive oxygen species, improved renal endothelium-dependent vasodilation and kidney mitochondrial function, suggesting that avocado positively interacts with the angiotensin system.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

Helps control glycemia.[^1]

**Abstract:** Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and is one of the factors involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Obesity induces low‐grade inflammation and oxidative stress. The treatment for obesity involves changes in diet, physical activity, and even medication and surgery. Currently, the use of nutraceutical compounds is associated with health benefits. Ginger and avocado are used for many people all around the world; however, its effect as a nutraceutical compound is less known by the general population. For this reason, we searched information of the literature to point its effects on distinct mechanisms of defense against the obesity its comorbidities. The present review aimed showing that these nutraceuticals may be useful in obesity treatment. Reports have shown that ginger and avocado induce antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory effects by improving enzymatic activity and modulating obesity‐related impairments in the anti‐inflammatory system in different tissues, without side effects. Furthermore, ginger and avocado were found to be effective in reversing the harmful effects of obesity on blood lipids. In conclusion, on the basis of the positive effects of ginger and avocado in in vitro, animal, and human studies, these nutraceuticals may be useful in obesity treatment.<br>

**Abstract:** Previous studies have demonstrated that regular avocado consumption presents advantageous effects on cardiovascular system. However, little attention has been paid to the use of avocado as a dietary supplement, in particular, for individuals involved in physical exercise training. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of acute avocado pulp intake on cardiovascular and autonomic recovery subsequent to moderate exercise. Using a crossover, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial design, 16 healthy female adults underwent two protocols: Avocado pulp (600 mg in capsule) and placebo (600 mg starch in capsule). After the ingestion of Avocado pulp or placebo, the subjects were seated for 60 min at rest, followed by running on a treadmill at a submaximal level and then remained seated for 60 min during recovery from the exercise. Heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) [rMSSD, SD1, HF (ms2)] and skin conductance were evaluated before and during exercise, as well as during recovery. HR, systolic blood pressure, HRV and skin conductance recovered faster when subjects were given avocado pulp prior to exercise. In conclusion, avocado pulp improved cardiovascular and autonomic recovery after exercise, suggesting a reduced risk of cardiovascular events after exertion. The current results support the beneficial effects of ingestion of avocado prior to submaximal treadmill running.<br>
