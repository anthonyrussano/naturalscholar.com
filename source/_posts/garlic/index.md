**Garlic** (Allium sativum)

## Healing Properties

### Anti-obesity (weight loss)

Prevents weight gain related to high fat diet.[^2]

### Antiviral (anti-viral)

#### Anticytomegalovirus

### Weight Loss

Counteracts the effects of an High Fat Diet on body weight, adipose tissue weight, and serum lipid profiles.

#### Hypolipidemic (antihyperlipidemic)

Lipid-lowering effects, used in the treatment of high levels of fats, such as cholesterol, in the blood.[^2]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

## Synergistic Qualities

Onion & Garlic oils decreased the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL-Cholesterol and increased the serum level of HDL-Cholesterol.[^2]

Allium sativum and [Nigella sativa](/nigella-sativa) extracts showed a synergistic effect in controlling the Cytomegalovirus virus greater than each extract in a solo state.[^1]

Unfortunately, these drugs have dose-limiting renal and bone marrow toxicities. Also, the long-term therapy with these drugs, necessary for management of infection, has been associated with the development of clinically resistant strains of the virus. Therefore, antiviral agents would need to develop for the treatment and suppression of CMV disease. Natural products of plant origin are proving to be a valuable source for anti-viral agents. So, the aim of the current study was to in vitro evaluation of Allium sativum and Nigella sativa methanolic extracts as anti-CMV agents. Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) were infected with CMV and propagative, plaque assay of CMV titer was 9.5x106 (PFU/ml) at four days post infection. Two methanolic plants extracts showed anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) activity against CMV tissue culture which determined by cytopathic effects whereby, the number of staining survival cells were increased with the treatment by A. sativum or N. sativa methanolic extracts. While a mixture of both extracts showed a synergistic effect in controlling the virus greater than each extract in a solo state.</i><br>**Link:** [http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.microbiology.20180802.02.html#Sec4](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.microbiology.20180802.02.html#Sec4)<br>**Citations:**

The objective of this study was to explore the effects of garlic oil and onion oil on serum lipid levels in hyperlipidemia model rats, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention of hyperlipidemia through a dietary approach, and to explore the potential health benefits of garlic and onion. **Method** Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into eight groups based on their body weight and serum levels of triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC). The rats received repeated oral administration of volatile oils extracted from garlic and onion for 60 days. Serum lipids and parameters of obesity were examined. **Results** The volatile oils suppressed the HFD-induced body weight gain and tended to decrease adipose tissue weight. The oils decreased the levels of TG, TC and LDL-C and increased the serum level of HDL-C compared with the rats in the hyperlipidemia model groups (P < 0.05). The oils were also effective at improving the lipid profile and alleviating hepatic steatosis. **Conclusion** Our results implied that garlic oil and onion oil have anti-obesity properties that can counteract the effects of an HFD on body weight, adipose tissue weight, and serum lipid profiles.</i><br>**Link:** [https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-018-0275-x](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-018-0275-x)<br>**Citations:**
