The available scientific research on herbal bioenhancers has shown to produce more efficacious and safe medicine with significant effect on bioavailability when coadministered or pretreated with many drugs and neutraceuticals.  Among these natural extracts/compounds such as Zingiber officinale, Allium sativum, Carum carvi, Cuminum cyminum, quercetin, naringin, genistein, curcumin, glycyrrhizin, and capsaicin are included and discussed in this chapter.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=poqADwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA295&ots=mV2GGZfTZ3&dq=%22Cuminum%20cyminum%22&lr&pg=PA296#v=onepage&q=%22Cuminum%20cyminum%22&f=false)<br>**Citations:**
