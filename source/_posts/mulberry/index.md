Mulberry fruit has been reported to effectively reduce body weight by preventing visceral fat accumulation and limiting food intake.  Dried Mulberry fruit Powder supplementation has anti-obesity properties and also improves liver lipid profile, thus it can be developed as a food supplement for weight control and prevention against liver lipid accumulation (fatty liver disease) resulting from a high fat diet
