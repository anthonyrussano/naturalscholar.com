**Quercetin** is a flavonoid with notable pharmacological effects and promising therapeutic potential. It is widely distributed among plants and found commonly in daily diets predominantly in fruits and vegetables.[^1]

## Preparation

The recommended dosage of quercetin as a dietary supplement is 1 g/day.[^1]

### Bioavailability

Although showing efficacy in several in vitro and animal models, in vivo studies have reported that it is extensively metabolized upon absorption from the gut, affecting its bioavailability.[^1]

It also has low Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) penetrability, thus limiting its efficacy in combating neurodegenerative disorders.[^1]

## Sources

Pomegranate, Common rue, [Green tea](../green-tea), [Red onion](../onion), [Mango](../mango), Drumstick tree (Moringa oleifera), Quince, Goldenrod, Blueberries, Phaleria macrocarpa, Lepidium latifolium, Sapodilla, Chicory, Tomato, Apple, Grapevines, Buckthorn, Passion Flower, White mulberry or Tut (Morus alba), Ginkgo biloba (Maidenhair tree), St. John’s wort (hypericum), and Yarrow.

## Healing Properties

### Anti-carcinogenic

### Anti-inflammatory

Strong antiinflammatory activity.[^1]

### Anti-infective 

### Antioxidant

Quercetin is one of the most potent antioxidants of plant origin and is one of the predominant
flavonoids found more commonly in edible plants.[^1]

- Quercetin has direct radical scavenging action.[^1]

### Brain Health

#### Neuroprotective

Neuroprotection by quercetin has been reported in several in vitro studies.[^1]

- Stimulates neuronal regeneration.[^1]
- After absorption, quercetin metabolites are glucuronated, methylated, or sulfated, and all have been shown to afford neuroprotection.[^1]

- Quercetin protects against mitochondrial dysfunction and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration.[^1]

##### Antioxidant

It has been shown to protect neurons from oxidative damage while reducing lipid peroxidation.[^1]

##### Anti-inflammatory / Anti-Amyloid Fibrils

In addition to its antioxidant properties, it inhibits the fibril formation of amyloid-β proteins, counteracting cell lyses and inflammatory cascade pathways.[^1]

- Suppresses neuroinflammatory processes by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.[^1]
- Prevents the degradation of acetylcholine, and decreases Aβ production.[^1]

#### Cognitive performance.

- Quercetin restores acetylcholine levels through the inhibition of hydrolysis of acetylcholine by AChE enzyme.[^1]

##### Memory Enhancer

Quercetin and rutin have been reported to function as memory enhancers in scopolamine-induced memory impairment tests, thus possibly enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.[^1]

##### Psychostimulant

### Blood Health

Inhibits platelet aggregation.[^1]

### Energy Production

Stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis.[^1]

- Quercetin ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential, decreases ROS
production, and restores ATP synthesis.[^1]
    - It also increases the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key cell regulator of energy metabolism.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Neurodegenerative Diseases

#### Neuroinflammation

Reducing the neuroinflammatory events in microglia might afford a beneficial strategy for the
prevention of the progression of inflammatory-mediated neurodegenerative disorders.[^1]

Quercetin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory actions, and is a suitable candidate among phytochemicals for future studies on its efficacy to reverse neuroinflammation.[^1]

Quercetin has been shown to inhibit neuroinflammation by reducing nitric oxide production, iNOS gene expression in microglia, the production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as a reduction
in cytokine expression as reported from in vivo studies.[^1]

#### Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

- Reverses histopathological hallmarks of AD[^1]
- Improves motor function[^1]
- Reduces α-synuclein fibrillization[^1]
- Reduces hippocampal neuronal cell death[^1]
- Improves synaptic plasticity[^1]
- Quercetin has shown therapeutic efficacy, improving learning, memory, and cognitive functions in
AD.[^1]
- Quercetin administration reverses extracellular β-amyloidosis and decreases tauopathies, astrogliosis, and microgliosis in the hippocampus and amygdale, thus protecting cognitive and emotional function in age triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease model.[^1]

Quercetin interferes with the formation of neurotoxic oligomeric Aβ species and displays fibril destabilizing effects on preformed fibrillar Aβ, reversing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.[^1]

#### Cognitive Impairment

#### Ischemia

#### Traumatic injury (brain/spinal)

Isoquercetin improved motor functions in acute spinal cord injury.[^1]

#### Parkinson’s disease

#### Huntington’s disease
