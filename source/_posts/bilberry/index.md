Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus)

## Composition

- Bilberry fruits contain larger amounts of catechin-type tannins.[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Anticholinesterase)

Bilberry extract demonstrates moderate Acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

- Inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine, thereby increases both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.[^1]
- There is a strong positive correlation between anticholinesterase activity and total condensed tannins.

### Neuroprotective

### Antimutagenic

### Antiaging

### Antioxidant

Anthocyanins represent the main antioxidant compounds in wild berries.  Bilberries contain anthocyanins mainly in the form of glucosides, galactosides and arabinosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, petunidin and peonidin.[^1]

### Antiinflammatory

### Chelator

Chelation of metal ions

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Alzheimer's Disease

### Cancer

#### Colorectal cancer

## Synergistic Effects

- 33% bilberry / 67% blackcurrant blend has the best synergistic effect.[^1]
