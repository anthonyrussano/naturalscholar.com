**Coenzyme-Q10**[^1]

## Healing Properties

### Anticancer

The anticancer effects of coenzyme Q10 were stronger with the addition of β-glucan. There is significant synergy between coenzyme Q10 and β-glucan.

### Antiinflammatory

Strong Antiinflammatory effects.

### Antioxidant

#### Skin Health

- Coenzyme Q10 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death and enhances the synthesis of basement membrane components in dermal and epidermal cells.[^2]

##### Photoprotective

- Topical application of CoQ10 has the beneficial effect of preventing photoaging.[^2]

###### UV Protection

- CoQ10 was shown to reduce UVA-induced MMPs in cultured human dermal fibroblasts.[^2]
  - MMPs (Matrix Metalloproteinases) are enzymes activated by UV exposure or inflammation. MMPs contribute to the breakdown of collagen while inhibiting new collagen formation.[^3]

### Heart Health

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Cancer

### Heart Disease

[^1]: **Title:** Combination Therapy with Glucan and Coenzyme Q10 in Murine Experimental Autoimmune Disease and Cancer<br>**Author(s):** VACLAV VETVICKA and JANA VETVICKOVA<br>**Institution(s):** University of Louisville, Department of Pathology, Louisville, KY, U.S.A.<br>**Publication:** <i>International Journal of Cancer Research and Treatment</i><br>**Date:** June 2018<br>**Abstract:** <i>Background/Aim: Coenzyme Q10 is a well-accepted anti-oxidant agent known to play a protective role in various physiological and disease processes. Recently, Coenzyme Q10 is gaining attention as a substance with significant Antiinflammatory properties. β-Glucan is the most studied immunomodulator with significant synergetic effects with numerous bioactive molecules. We aimed to evaluate the possible synergistic effects of simultaneous use of coenzyme Q10 with the well-established immune modulator, β-glucan, on immune reactions and cancer development. Materials and Methods: Coenzyme Q10 and β-glucan were used, both in vivo and in vitro, and their effects were evaluated using phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. Results: Our study confirmed the strong Antiinflammatory effects of coenzyme Q10 and showed that these effects were further potentiated with the addition of β-glucan. The anticancer effects of coenzyme Q10 were less pronounced, but stronger, with the addition of β-glucan. Conclusion: There is significant synergy between coenzyme Q10 and β-glucan.</i><br>**Link:** [http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/38/6/3291.full](http://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/38/6/3291.full)<br>**Citations:**

[^2]: **Study Type:** Preprint: Review Paper<br>**Title:** An extensive Review of Sunscreen and Suntan Preparations<br>**Author(s):** AK Mohiuddin<br>**Institution(s):** Department of Pharmacy, World University of Bangladesh; 151/8, Green Road, Dhanmondi, Dhaka –1205, Bangladesh<br>**Publication:** <i>Preprint</i><br>**Date:** April 2019<br>**Abstract:** <i>The sunscreen industry is achieving remarkable worldwide prominence by responding to the growing need for skin protection with fast-paced innovation. Increased consumer awareness of the harmful effects of sunlight has fueled the demand for improved photo protection. The need for broad-spectrum protection from both UVA and UVB rays has inspired scientists worldwide to research new cosmetic formulations and delivery systems. More effective sunscreen actives, emollients and novel cosmetic and functional ingredients have been regularly added to the formulator’s repertoire. Creativity in innovation has been hindered only by regulatory agencies and patent restrictions worldwide. Familiarity with the current restrictive regulations and patent law infringements has become integral to any research effort attempting to provide improved protection to individuals affected by the sun’s damaging effects. The increasing incidence of skin cancers and photo damaging effects caused by ultraviolet radiation has increased the use of sun screening agents, which have shown beneficial effects in reducing the symptoms and reoccurrence of these problems. Unlike the situation in Europe where sunscreen ingredients are considered under cosmetics guidelines, the FDA is required to define sunscreens as drugs since they are advertised to prevent sunburn and, more recently, the risk of skin cancer. In the USA, the FDA has been regulating this industry since August 25, 1978, with the publication of the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Sunscreens are considered drugs and cosmetics and therefore must be governed by the FDA-OTC monograph. With the variety of sunscreen agents used in cosmetic and UV protection products, Australia, Canada, and the European Union (EU) have also developed regulatory protocols on safe sunscreen product use. Unlike the USA though, Australia has approved 34 active sunscreen ingredients and the EU has approved 28 of these ingredients. Current FDA regulations allow labeling of sunscreen products to a maximum of 30þ, despite the many products currently available with numbers as high as 100. From a cosmetic formulation point of view, increasing the SPF number in a product is governed by simple chemical principles.</i><br>**Link:** [Source](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/201904.0327/v1/download)<br>**Citations:**
