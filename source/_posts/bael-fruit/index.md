The Bael Fruit comes from a species of tree (Aegle marmelos L.) native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

Also known as Bengal quince, golden apple, Japanese bitter orange, stone apple or wood apple.

## Composition

- The bael tree contains furocoumarins (Note: Furanocoumarins, or furocoumarins, are a class of organic chemical compounds produced by a variety of plants. Many furanocoumarin compounds are toxic.)
    - Including xanthotoxol and the methyl ester of alloimperatorin
- The bael tree fruit contains coumarins such as marmelosin (also known as imperatorin)
-Flavonoids
    - Rutin and marmesin
- Essential oils
- Alkaloids
    - allocryptopine
    - O-isopentenylhalfordinol
    - O-methylhafordinol.
    - Aegeline (N-[2-hydroxy-2(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide) is a constituent that can be extracted from bael leaves.

Aeglemarmelosine, molecular formula C16H15NO2 [α]27D+7.89° (c 0.20, CHCl3), has been isolated as an orange viscous oil.

## Preparation

The fruit can reach the size of a large grapefruit or bigger. The shell is hard and must be cracked with a tool. The fibrous yellow pulp is very aromatic, described as tasting of marmalade and smelling of roses.

The fruits can be eaten fresh or dried, into pulp powder or nectar. If fresh, the juice is strained and sweetened to make a drink similar to lemonade.

The leaves and small shoots are eaten as salad greens.

The leaves, bark, roots, fruits, and seeds are used in traditional medicine.

## Healing Properties

### Antioxidant

A rich source of antioxidants.[^1]

Herbal tea prepared with dried bael fruits is a rich source of water-soluble phenolic compounds with demonstrated potent antioxidant activities.[^1]

## Disease / Symptom Treatment

### Diabetes

May help control the complications of type 2 diabetes.[^1]

Bael fruit tea tested in this study was found effective in increasing plasma antioxidant activity with the potential of reducing oxidative stress and help controlling secondary complications of type 2 diabetes and maintaining health and wellness.[^1]

**Abstract:** Herbal teas are globally popular among health conscious consumers. In this study the phenolic content and potential antioxidant activities of bael fruit herbal tea prepared with dried immature bael fruit cuts (Aegle marmelos), traditionally used in the Asia, were determined. Phenolic compounds of the herbal extracts were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activities of the tested herbal extract was determined. The amount of herbal material to be used in the tea preparation was established based on the sensory evaluation conducted with 50 untrained adult panelists. The single dose efficacy of the bael fruit herbal tea on postprandial glycemic response and plasma antioxidant capacity (PAC) of healthy adults were investigated. A randomized crossover study was carried out with 16 healthy adults who consumed 250 mL bael fruit tea with 50 g glucose challenge and the control (50 g glucose in 250 mL water) randomly within two visits. Blood samples were collected at the baseline and postprandial at 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min using microcapillary tubes. The plasma was analyzed for glucose concentration (PGC) and PAC. The TPC of bael fruit tea extract was 108.3 μmol gallic acid equivalents/g of extract. There was a reduction trend in mean PGC of those subjects who consumed bael fruit tea compared to the glucose added water (control) at each time point. Furthermore, the bael fruit tea significantly increased PAC at the end of 120 min post ingestion. Further research is warranted to examine the long-term efficacy of multiple dose ingestion of bael fruit herbal tea in the control and management of diseases associated with oxidative stress.<br>
