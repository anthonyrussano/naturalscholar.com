**Bromelain** is an enzyme found in pineapples, it exists in all parts of the fresh plant and fruit.[^1] Bromelain is used for reducing swelling (inflammation), especially of the nose and sinuses, after surgery or injury.  The term "bromelain" may refer to either of two protease enzymes extracted from the plants of the family Bromeliaceae, or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.
